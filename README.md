# SPECIALIZATION-PROEJECT

This project was created in the summer semester at Roskilde University in 2025.

## Data

As ground truth we are using this git repo: <https://github.com/rescribe/carolineminuscule-groundtruth>

In the ground truth data set there are:
Text files (.txt): 454
Image files (.png): 429
Image files (.xml): 17
Total files: 900
The images are mostly precut and already greyscaled. Therefore it's easier to work with them.
