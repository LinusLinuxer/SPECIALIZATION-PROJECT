 QUIET ON THE W
ESTERN FRONT CH
APTER I We are 
at rest five mi
les behind the 
front. Yesterda
y we were relie
ved, and now ou
r bellies are f
ull of beef and
 haricot beans.
 We are satisfi
ed and at peace
. Each man has 
another mess-ti
n full for the 
evening; and, w
hat is more, th
ere is a double
 ration of saus
age and bread. 
That puts a man
 in fine trim. 
We have not had
 such luck as t
his for a long 
time. The cook 
with his carrot
y head is beggi
ng us to eat; h
e beckons with 
his ladle to ev
ery one that pa
sses, and spoon
s him out a gre
at dollop. He d
oes not see how
 he can empty h
is stew-pot in 
time for coffee
. Tjaden and Mü
ller have produ
ced two wash-ba
sins and had th
em filled up to
 the brim as a 
reserve. In Tja
den this is vor
acity, in Mülle
r it is foresig
ht. Where Tjade
n puts it all i
s a mystery, fo
r he is and alw
ays will be as 
thin as a rake.
 What's more im
portant still i
s the issue of 
a double ration
 of smokes. Ten
 cigars, twenty
 cigarettes, an
d two quids of 
chew per man; n
ow that is dece
nt. I have exch
anged my chewin
g tobacco with 
Katczinsky for 
his cigarettes,
 which means I 
have forty alto
gether. That's 
enough for a da
y. It is true w
e have no right
 to this windfa
ll. The Prussia
n is not so gen
erous. We have 
only a miscalcu
lation to thank
 for it. Fourte
en days ago we 
had to go up an
d relieve the f
ront line. It w
as fairly quiet
 on our sector,
 so the quarter
master who rema
ined in the rea
r had requisiti
oned the usual 
quantity of rat
ions and provid
ed for the full
 company of one
 hundred and fi
fty men. But on
 the last day a
n astonishing n
umber of Englis
h field-guns op
ened up on us w
ith high-explos
ive, drumming c
easelessly on o
ur position, so
 that we suffer
ed heavily and 
came back only 
eighty strong. 
Last night we m
oved back and s
ettled down to 
get a good slee
p for once: Kat
czinsky is righ
t when he says 
it would not be
 such a bad war
 if only one co
uld get a littl
e more sleep. I
n the line we h
ave had next to
 none, and four
teen days is a 
long time at on
e stretch. It w
as noon before 
the first of us
 crawled out of
 our quarters. 
Half an hour la
ter every man h
ad his mess-tin
 and we gathere
d at the cook-h
ouse, which sme
lt greasy and n
ourishing. At t
he head of the 
queue of course
 were the hungr
iest--little Al
bert Kropp, the
 clearest think
er among us and
 therefore the 
first to be lan
ce-corporal; Mü
ller, who still
 carries his sc
hool textbooks 
with him, dream
s of examinatio
ns, and during 
a bombardment m
utters proposit
ions in physics
; Leer, who wea
rs a full beard
 and has a pref
erence for the 
girls from offi
cers' brothels.
 He swears that
 they are oblig
ed by an army o
rder to wear si
lk chemises and
 to bathe befor
e entertaining 
guests of the r
ank of major an
d upwards. And 
as the fourth, 
myself, Paul Bä
umer. All four 
are nineteen ye
ars of age, and
 all four joine
d up from the s
ame class as vo
lunteers for th
e war. Close be
hind us were ou
r friends: Tjad
en, a skinny lo
ck-smith of our
 own age, the b
iggest eater of
 the company. H
e sits down to 
eat as thin as 
a grasshopper a
nd gets up as b
ig as a bug in 
the family way;
 Haie Westhus, 
of the same age
, a peat-digger
, who can easil
y hold a ration
-loaf in his ha
nd and say: Gue
ss what I've go
t in my fist; t
hen Detering, a
 peasant, who t
hinks of nothin
g but his farm-
yard and his wi
fe; and finally
 Stanislaus Kat
czinsky, the le
ader of our gro
up, shrewd, cun
ning, and hard-
bitten, forty y
ears of age, wi
th a face of th
e soil, blue ey
es, bent should
ers, and a rema
rkable nose for
 dirty weather,
 good food, and
 soft jobs. Our
 gang formed th
e head of the q
ueue before the
 cook-house. We
 were growing i
mpatient, for t
he cook paid no
 attention to u
s. Finally Katc
zinsky called o
ut to him: "Say
, Heinrich, ope
n up the soup-k
itchen. Anyone 
can see the bea
ns are done." H
e shook his hea
d sleepily: "Yo
u must all be t
here first." Tj
aden grinned: "
We are all here
." The sergeant
-cook still too
k no notice. "T
hat may do for 
you," he said. 
"But where are 
the others?" "T
hey won't be fe
d by you to-day
. They're eithe
r in the dressi
ng-station or p
ushing up daisi
es." The cook w
as quite discon
certed as the f
acts dawned on 
him. He was sta
ggered. "And I 
have cooked for
 one hundred an
d fifty men----
" Kropp poked h
im in the ribs.
 "Then for once
 we'll have eno
ugh. Come on, b
egin!" Suddenly
 a vision came 
over Tjaden. Hi
s sharp, mousey
 features began
 to shine, his 
eyes grew small
 with cunning, 
his jaws twitch
ed, and he whis
pered hoarsely:
 "Man! then you
've got bread f
or one hundred 
and fifty men t
oo, eh?" The se
rgeant-cook nod
ded absent-mind
ed, and bewilde
red. Tjaden sei
zed him by the 
tunic. "And sau
sage?" Ginger n
odded again. Tj
aden's chaps qu
ivered. "Tobacc
o too?" "Yes, e
verything." Tja
den beamed: "Wh
at a bean-feast
! That's all fo
r us! Each man 
gets--wait a bi
t--yes, practic
ally two issues
." Then Ginger 
stirred himself
 and said: "Tha
t won't do." Th
en we got excit
ed and began to
 crowd around. 
"Why won't that
 do, you old ca
rrot?" demanded
 Katczinsky. "E
ighty men can't
 have what is m
eant for a hund
red and fifty."
 "We'll soon sh
ow you," growle
d Müller. "I do
n't care about 
the stew, but I
 can only issue
 rations for ei
ghty men," pers
isted Ginger. K
atczinsky got a
ngry. "You migh
t be generous f
or once. You ha
ven't drawn foo
d for eighty me
n. You've drawn
 it for the Sec
ond Company. Go
od. Let's have 
it then. We are
 the Second Com
pany." We began
 to jostle the 
fellow. No one 
felt kindly tow
ard him, for it
 was his fault 
that the food t
wice came up to
 us in the line
 too late and c
old. Under shel
l-fire he would
n't bring his k
itchen up near 
enough, so that
 our soup-carri
ers had to go m
uch farther tha
n those of the 
other companies
. Now Bulcke of
 the First Comp
any is a much b
etter fellow. H
e is as fat as 
a hamster in wi
nter, but he tr
undles his pots
 when it comes 
to that right u
p to the very f
ront line. We w
ere in just the
 right mood, an
d there would c
ertainly have b
een a dust-up i
f our company c
ommander had no
t appeared. He 
informed himsel
f of the disput
e, and only rem
arked: "Yes, we
 did have heavy
 losses yesterd
ay." He looked 
in the dixie. "
The beans look 
good." Ginger n
odded. "Cooked 
with meat and f
at." The lieute
nant looked at 
us. He knew wha
t we were think
ing. And he kne
w many other th
ings too, becau
se he came to t
he company as a
 non-com. and w
as promoted fro
m the ranks. He
 lifted the lid
 from the dixie
 again and snif
fed. Then passi
ng on he said: 
"Serve out the 
whole issue. We
 can do with it
. And bring me 
a plate full to
o." Ginger look
ed sheepish as 
Tjaden danced r
ound him. "It d
oesn't cost you
 anything! One 
would think the
 quartermaster'
s store belonge
d to him! And n
ow get on with 
it, you old blu
bber-sticker, a
nd don't you mi
scount either."
 "You be hanged
!" spat out Gin
ger. When thing
s get beyond hi
m he throws up 
the sponge alto
gether; he just
 goes to pieces
. And as if to 
show that all t
hings were now 
the same to him
, of his own fr
ee will he shar
ed out half a p
ound of synthet
ic honey equall
y among us. To-
day is wonderfu
lly good. The m
ail has come, a
nd almost every
 man has a coup
le of letters a
nd papers. We s
troll over to t
he meadow behin
d the billets. 
Kropp has the r
ound lid of a m
argarine tub un
der his arm. On
 the right side
 of the meadow 
a large common 
latrine has bee
n built, a well
-planned and du
rable construct
ion. But that i
s for recruits 
who as yet have
 not learned ho
w to make the m
ost of whatever
 comes their wa
y. We look for 
something bette
r. Scattered ab
out everywhere 
there are separ
ate, individual
 boxes for the 
same purpose. T
hey are square,
 neat boxes wit
h wooden sides 
all round, and 
have unimpeacha
bly satisfactor
y seats. On the
 sides are hand
-grips enabling
 one to shift t
hem about. We m
ove three toget
her in a ring a
nd sit down com
fortably. For t
wo hours we hav
e been here wit
hout getting up
. I well rememb
er how embarras
sed we were as 
recruits in bar
racks when we h
ad to use the g
eneral latrine.
 There were no 
doors and twent
y men sat side 
by side as in a
 railway carria
ge, so that the
y could be revi
ewed all at one
 glance, for so
ldiers must alw
ays be under su
pervision. Sinc
e then we have 
learned better 
than to be shy 
about such trif
ling immodestie
s. In time thin
gs far worse th
an that came ea
sy to us. Here 
in the open air
 though, the bu
siness is entir
ely a pleasure.
 I no longer un
derstand why we
 should always 
have shied at i
t before. It is
, in fact, just
 as natural as 
eating and drin
king. We did no
t properly appr
eciate these bo
xes when we fir
st enlisted; th
ey were new to 
us and did not 
fill such an im
portant rôle--b
ut now they hav
e long been a m
atter of course
. The soldier i
s on friendlier
 terms than oth
er men with his
 stomach and in
testines. Three
-quarters of hi
s vocabulary is
 derived from t
hese regions, a
nd they give an
 intimate flavo
ur to expressio
ns of his great
est joy as well
 as of his deep
est indignation
. It is impossi
ble to express 
oneself in any 
other way so cl
early and pithi
ly. Our familie
s and our teach
ers will be sho
cked when we go
 home, but here
 it is the univ
ersal language.
 Enforced publi
city has in our
 eyes restored 
the character o
f complete inno
cence to all th
ese things. Mor
e than that, th
ey are so much 
a matter of cou
rse that their 
comfortable per
formance is ful
ly as much enjo
yed as the play
ing of a safe t
op running flus
h. Not for noth
ing was the wor
d "latrine-rumo
ur" invented; t
hese places are
 the regimental
 gossip-shops a
nd common-rooms
. We feel ourse
lves for the ti
me being better
 off than in an
y palatial whit
e-tiled "conven
ience." _There_
 it can only be
 hygienic; _her
e_ it is beauti
ful. These are 
wonderfully car
e-free hours. O
ver us is the b
lue sky. On the
 horizon float 
the bright yell
ow, sunlit obse
rvation-balloon
s, and the many
 little white c
louds of the an
ti-aircraft she
lls. Often they
 rise in a shea
f as they follo
w after an airm
an. We hear the
 muffled rumble
 of the front o
nly as very dis
tant thunder, b
umble-bees dron
ing by quite dr
own it. Around 
us stretches th
e flowery meado
w. The grasses 
sway their tall
 spears; the wh
ite butterflies
 flutter around
 and float on t
he soft warm wi
nd of the late 
summer. We read
 letters and ne
wspapers and sm
oke. We take of
f our caps and 
lay them down b
eside us. The w
ind plays with 
our hair; it pl
ays with our wo
rds and thought
s. The three bo
xes stand in th
e midst of the 
glowing, red fi
eld-poppies. We
 set the lid of
 the margarine 
tub on our knee
s and so have a
 good table for
 a game of skat
. Kropp has the
 cards with him
. After every t
hrow-in the los
er pays into th
e pool. One cou
ld sit like thi
s for ever. The
 notes of an ac
cordion float a
cross from the 
billets. Often 
we lay aside th
e cards and loo
k about us. One
 of us will say
: "Well, boys..
.." Or "It was 
a near thing th
at time...." An
d for a moment 
we fall silent.
 There is in ea
ch of us a feel
ing of constrai
nt. We are all 
sensible of it;
 it needs no wo
rds to communic
ate it. It migh
t easily have h
appened that we
 should not be 
sitting here on
 our boxes to-d
ay; it came dam
n near to that.
 And so everyth
ing is new and 
brave, red popp
ies and good fo
od, cigarettes 
and summer bree
ze. Kropp asks:
 "Anyone seen K
emmerich lately
?" "He's up at 
St. Joseph's," 
I tell him. Mül
ler explains th
at he has a fle
sh wound in his
 thigh; a good 
blighty. We dec
ide to go and s
ee him this aft
ernoon. Kropp p
ulls out a lett
er. "Kantorek s
ends you all hi
s best wishes."
 We laugh. Müll
er throws his c
igarette away a
nd says: "I wis
h he was here."
 * * Kantorek h
ad been our sch
oolmaster, an a
ctive little ma
n in a grey tai
l-coat, with a 
face like a shr
ew-mouse. He wa
s about the sam
e size as Corpo
ral Himmelstoss
, the "Terror o
f Klosterberg."
 It is very que
er that the unh
appiness of the
 world is so of
ten brought on 
by small men. T
hey are so much
 more energetic
 and uncompromi
sing than the b
ig fellows. I h
ave always take
n good care to 
keep out of sec
tions with smal
l company comma
nders. They are
 mostly confoun
ded little mart
inets. During d
rill-time Kanto
rek gave us lon
g lectures unti
l the whole of 
our class went 
under his sheph
erding to the D
istrict Command
ant and volunte
ered. I can see
 him now, as he
 used to glare 
at us through h
is spectacles a
nd say in a mov
ing voice: "Won
't you join up,
 Comrades." The
se teachers alw
ays carry their
 feelings ready
 in their waist
coat pockets, a
nd fetch them o
ut at any hour 
of the day. But
 we didn't thin
k of that then.
 There was, ind
eed, one of us 
who hesitated a
nd did not want
 to fall into l
ine. That was J
osef Behm, a pl
ump, homely fel
low. But he did
 allow himself 
to be persuaded
, otherwise he 
would have been
 ostracized. An
d perhaps more 
of us thought a
s he did, but n
o one could ver
y well stand ou
t, because at t
hat time even o
ne's parents we
re ready with t
he word "coward
"; no one had t
he vaguest idea
 what we were i
n for. The wise
st were just th
e poor and simp
le people. They
 knew the war t
o be a misfortu
ne, whereas peo
ple who were be
tter off were b
eside themselve
s with joy, tho
ugh they should
 have been much
 better able to
 judge what the
 consequences w
ould be. Katczi
nsky said that 
was a result of
 their upbringi
ng. It made the
m stupid. And w
hat Kat said, h
e had thought a
bout. Strange t
o say, Behm was
 one of the fir
st to fall. He 
got hit in the 
eye during an a
ttack, and we l
eft him lying f
or dead. We cou
ldn't bring him
 with us, becau
se we had to co
me back helter-
skelter. In the
 afternoon sudd
enly we heard h
im call, and sa
w him outside c
reeping towards
 us. He had onl
y been knocked 
unconscious. Be
cause he could 
not see, and wa
s mad with pain
, he failed to 
keep under cove
r, and so was s
hot down before
 anyone could g
o and fetch him
 in. Naturally 
we couldn't bla
me Kantorek for
 this. Where wo
uld the world b
e if one brough
t every man to 
book? There wer
e thousands of 
Kantoreks, all 
of whom were co
nvinced that th
ere was only on
e way of doing 
well, and that 
way theirs. And
 that is just w
hy they let us 
down so badly. 
For us lads of 
eighteen they o
ught to have be
en mediators an
d guides to the
 world of matur
ity, the world 
of work, of dut
y, of culture, 
of progress--to
 the future. We
 often made fun
 of them and pl
ayed jokes on t
hem, but in our
 hearts we trus
ted them. The i
dea of authorit
y, which they r
epresented, was
 associated in 
our minds with 
a greater insig
ht and a manlie
r wisdom. But t
he first death 
we saw shattere
d this belief. 
We had to recog
nize that our g
eneration was m
ore to be trust
ed than theirs.
 They surpassed
 us only in phr
ases and in cle
verness. The fi
rst bombardment
 showed us our 
mistake, and un
der it the worl
d as they had t
aught it to us 
broke in pieces
. While they co
ntinued to writ
e and talk, we 
saw the wounded
 and dying. Whi
le they taught 
that duty to on
e's country is 
the greatest th
ing, we already
 knew that deat
h-throes are st
ronger. But for
 all that we we
re no mutineers
, no deserters,
 no cowards--th
ey were very fr
ee with all the
se expressions.
 We loved our c
ountry as much 
as they, we wen
t courageously 
into every acti
on; but also we
 distinguished 
the false from 
the true, we ha
d suddenly lear
ned to see. And
 we saw that th
ere was nothing
 of their world
 left. We were 
all at once ter
ribly alone; an
d alone we must
 see it through
. * * Before go
ing over to see
 Kemmerich we p
ack up his thin
gs: he will nee
d them on the w
ay back. In the
 dressing stati
on there is gre
at activity; it
 reeks as ever 
of carbolic, et
her, and sweat.
 Most of us are
 accustomed to 
this in the bil
lets, but here 
it makes one fe
el faint. We as
k for Kemmerich
. He lies in a 
large room and 
receives us wit
h feeble expres
sions of joy an
d helpless agit
ation. While he
 was unconsciou
s someone had s
tolen his watch
. Müller shakes
 his head: "I a
lways told you 
that nobody sho
uld carry as go
od a watch as t
hat." Müller is
 rather crude a
nd tactless, ot
herwise he woul
d hold his tong
ue, for anybody
 can see that K
emmerich will n
ever come out o
f this place ag
ain. Whether he
 finds his watc
h or not will m
ake no differen
ce. At the most
 one will only 
be able to send
 it to his peop
le. "How goes i
t, Franz?" asks
 Kropp. Kemmeri
ch's head sinks
. "Not so bad .
.. but I have s
uch a damned pa
in in my foot."
 We look at his
 bed covering. 
His leg lies un
der a wire bask
et. The bed cov
ering arches ov
er it. I kick M
üller on the sh
in, for he is j
ust about to te
ll Kemmerich wh
at the orderlie
s told us outsi
de: that Kemmer
ich has lost hi
s foot. The leg
 is amputated. 
He looks ghastl
y, yellow, and 
wan. In his fac
e there are alr
eady the strain
ed lines that w
e know so well,
 we have seen t
hem now hundred
s of times. The
y are not so mu
ch lines as mar
ks. Under the s
kin the life no
 longer pulses,
 it has already
 pressed out to
 the boundaries
 of the body. D
eath is working
 through from w
ithin. It alrea
dy has command 
in the eyes. He
re lies our com
rade, Kemmerich
, who a little 
while ago was r
oasting horse-f
lesh with us an
d squatting in 
the shell-holes
. He it is stil
l and yet it is
 not he any lon
ger. His featur
es have become 
uncertain and f
aint, like a ph
otographic plat
e on which two 
pictures have b
een taken. Even
 his voice soun
ds like ashes. 
I think of the 
time when we we
nt away. His mo
ther, a good pl
ump matron, bro
ught him to the
 station. She w
ept continually
, her face was 
bloated and swo
llen. Kemmerich
 felt embarrass
ed, for she was
 the least comp
osed of all; sh
e simply dissol
ved into fat an
d water. Then s
he caught sight
 of me and took
 hold of my arm
 again and agai
n, and implored
 me to look aft
er Franz out th
ere. Indeed he 
did have a face
 like a child, 
and such frail 
bones that afte
r four weeks pa
ck-carrying he 
already had fla
t feet. But how
 can a man look
 after anyone i
n the field! "N
ow you will soo
n be going home
," says Kropp. 
"You would have
 had to wait at
 least three or
 four months fo
r your leave." 
Kemmerich nods.
 I cannot bear 
to look at his 
hands, they are
 like wax. Unde
r the nails is 
the dirt of the
 trenches, it s
hows through bl
ue-black like p
oison. It strik
es me that thes
e nails will co
ntinue to grow 
like long fanta
stic cellar-pla
nts long after 
Kemmerich breat
hes no more. I 
see the picture
 before me. The
y twist themsel
ves into corksc
rews and grow a
nd grow, and wi
th them the hai
r on the decaye
d skull, just l
ike grass in a 
good soil, just
 like grass, ho
w can it be pos
sible---- Mülle
r leans over. "
We have brought
 your things, F
ranz." Kemmeric
h signs with hi
s hand. "Put th
em under the be
d." Müller does
 so. Kemmerich 
starts on again
 about the watc
h. How can one 
calm him withou
t making him su
spicious? Mülle
r reappears wit
h a pair of air
man's boots. Th
ey are fine Eng
lish boots of s
oft, yellow lea
ther which reac
h to the knee a
nd lace all the
 way--they are 
things to be co
veted. Müller i
s delighted at 
the sight of th
em. He matches 
their soles aga
inst his own cl
umsy boots and 
says: "Will you
 be taking them
 with you then,
 Franz?" We all
 three have the
 same thought; 
even if he shou
ld get better, 
he would be abl
e to use only o
ne--they are no
 use to him. Bu
t as things are
 now it is a pi
ty that they sh
ould stay here;
 the orderlies 
will of course 
grab them as so
on as he is dea
d. "Won't you l
eave them with 
us?" Müller rep
eats. Kemmerich
 doesn't want t
o. They are his
 most prized po
ssessions. "Wel
l, we could exc
hange," suggest
s Müller again.
 "Out here one 
can make some u
se of them." St
ill Kemmerich i
s not to be mov
ed. I tread on 
Müller's foot; 
reluctantly he 
puts the fine b
oots back again
 under the bed.
 We talk a litt
le more and the
n take our leav
e. "Cheerio, Fr
anz." I promise
 him to come ba
ck in the morni
ng. Müller talk
s of doing so t
oo. He is think
ing of the lace
-up boots and m
eans to be on t
he spot. Kemmer
ich groans. He 
is feverish. We
 get hold of an
 orderly outsid
e and ask him t
o give Kemmeric
h a dose of mor
phia. He refuse
s. "If we were 
to give morphia
 to everyone we
 would have to 
have tubs full-
---" "You only 
attend to offic
ers properly," 
says Kropp vici
ously. I hastil
y intervene and
 give him a cig
arette. He take
s it. "Are you 
usually allowed
 to give it, th
en?" I ask him.
 He is annoyed.
 "If you don't 
think so, then 
why do you ask?
" I press a cou
ple more cigare
ttes into his h
and. "Do us the
 favour----" "W
ell, all right,
" he says. Krop
p goes in with 
him. He doesn't
 trust him and 
wants to see. W
e wait outside.
 Müller returns
 to the subject
 of the boots. 
"They would fit
 me perfectly. 
In these boots 
I get blister a
fter blister. D
o you think he 
will last till 
to-morrow after
 drill? If he p
asses out in th
e night, we kno
w where the boo
ts----" Kropp r
eturns. "Do you
 think----?" he
 asks. "Done fo
r," says Müller
 emphatically. 
We go back to t
he huts. I thin
k of the letter
 that I must wr
ite to-morrow t
o Kemmerich's m
other. I am fre
ezing. I could 
do with a tot o
f rum. Müller p
ulls up some gr
ass and chews i
t. Suddenly lit
tle Kropp throw
s his cigarette
 away, stamps o
n it savagely, 
and looking rou
nd him with a b
roken and distr
acted face, sta
mmers: "Damned 
shit, the damne
d shit!" We wal
k on for a long
 time. Kropp ha
s calmed himsel
f; we understan
d: he sees red,
 out here every
 man gets like 
that sometime. 
"What has Kanto
rek written to 
you?" Müller as
ks him. He laug
hs. "We are the
 Iron Youth." W
e all three smi
le bitterly. Kr
opp rails: he i
s glad that he 
can speak. Yes,
 that's the way
 they think, th
ese hundred tho
usand Kantoreks
! Iron Youth. Y
outh! We are no
ne of us more t
han twenty year
s old. But youn
g? Youth? That 
is long ago. We
 are old folk. 
CHAPTER II It i
s strange to th
ink that at hom
e in the drawer
 of my writing 
table there lie
s the beginning
 of a play call
ed "Saul" and a
 bundle of poem
s. Many an even
ing I have work
ed over them--w
e all did somet
hing of the kin
d--but that has
 become so unre
al to me that I
 cannot compreh
end it any more
. Our early lif
e is cut off fr
om the moment w
e came here, an
d that without 
our lifting a h
and. We often t
ry to look back
 on it and to f
ind an explanat
ion, but never 
quite succeed. 
For us young me
n of twenty eve
rything is extr
aordinarily vag
ue, for Kropp, 
Müller, Leer, a
nd me, for all 
of us whom Kant
orek calls the 
"Iron Youth." A
ll the older me
n are linked up
 with their pre
vious life. The
y have wives, c
hildren, occupa
tions, and inte
rests, they hav
e a background 
which is so str
ong that the wa
r cannot oblite
rate it. We you
ng men of twent
y, however, hav
e only our pare
nts, and some, 
perhaps, a girl
--that is not m
uch, for at our
 age the influe
nce of parents 
is at its weake
st and girls ha
ve not yet got 
a hold over us.
 Besides this t
here was little
 else--some ent
husiasm, a few 
hobbies, and ou
r school. Beyon
d this our life
 did not extend
. And of this n
othing remains.
 Kantorek would
 say that we st
ood on the thre
shold of life. 
And so it would
 seem. We had a
s yet taken no 
root. The war s
wept us away. F
or the others, 
the older men, 
it is but an in
terruption. The
y are able to t
hink beyond it.
 We, however, h
ave been grippe
d by it and do 
not know what t
he end may be. 
We know only th
at in some stra
nge and melanch
oly way we have
 become a waste
 land. All the 
same, we are no
t often sad. * 
* Though Müller
 would be delig
hted to have Ke
mmerich's boots
, he is really 
quite as sympat
hetic as anothe
r who could not
 bear to think 
of such a thing
 for grief. He 
merely sees thi
ngs clearly. We
re Kemmerich ab
le to make any 
use of the boot
s, then Müller 
would rather go
 barefoot over 
barbed wire tha
n scheme how to
 get hold of th
em. But as it i
s the boots are
 quite inapprop
riate to Kemmer
ich's circumsta
nces, whereas M
üller can make 
good use of the
m. Kemmerich wi
ll die; it is i
mmaterial who g
ets them. Why, 
then, should Mü
ller not succee
d to them? he h
as more right t
han a hospital 
orderly. When K
emmerich is dea
d it will be to
o late. Therefo
re Müller is al
ready on the wa
tch. We have lo
st all sense of
 other consider
ations, because
 they are artif
icial. Only the
 facts are real
 and important 
for us. And goo
d boots are sca
rce. * * Once i
t was different
. When we went 
to the district
-commandant to 
enlist, we were
 a class of twe
nty young men, 
many of whom pr
oudly shaved fo
r the first tim
e before going 
to the barracks
. We had no def
inite plans for
 our future. Ou
r thoughts of a
 career and occ
upation were as
 yet of too unp
ractical a char
acter to furnis
h any scheme of
 life. We were 
still crammed f
ull of vague id
eas which gave 
to life, and to
 the war also, 
an ideal and al
most romantic c
haracter. We we
re trained in t
he army for ten
 weeks and in t
his time more p
rofoundly influ
enced than by t
en years at sch
ool. We learned
 that a bright 
button is weigh
tier than four 
volumes of Scho
penhauer. At fi
rst astonished,
 then embittere
d, and finally 
indifferent, we
 recognized tha
t what matters 
is not the mind
 but the boot b
rush, not intel
ligence but the
 system, not fr
eedom but drill
. We became sol
diers with eage
rness and enthu
siasm, but they
 have done ever
ything to knock
 that out of us
. After three w
eeks it was no 
longer incompre
hensible to us 
that a braided 
postman should 
have more autho
rity over us th
an had formerly
 our parents, o
ur teachers, an
d the whole gam
ut of culture f
rom Plato to Go
ethe. With our 
young, awakened
 eyes we saw th
at the classica
l conception of
 the Fatherland
 held by our te
achers resolved
 itself here in
to a renunciati
on of personali
ty such as one 
would not ask o
f the meanest s
ervant--salutes
, springing to 
attention, para
de-marches, pre
senting arms, r
ight wheel, lef
t wheel, clicki
ng the heels, i
nsults, and a t
housand pettifo
gging details. 
We had fancied 
our task would 
be different, o
nly to find we 
were to be trai
ned for heroism
 as though we w
ere circus-poni
es. But we soon
 accustomed our
selves to it. W
e learned in fa
ct that some pa
rt of these thi
ngs was necessa
ry, but the res
t merely show. 
Soldiers have a
 fine nose for 
such distinctio
ns. * * By thre
es and fours ou
r class was sca
ttered over the
 platoons among
st Frisian fish
ermen, peasants
, and labourers
 with whom we s
oon made friend
s. Kropp, Mülle
r, Kemmerich, a
nd I went to No
. 9 platoon und
er Corporal Him
melstoss. He ha
d the reputatio
n of being the 
strictest disci
plinarian in th
e camp, and was
 proud of it. H
e was a small u
ndersized fello
w with a foxy, 
waxed moustache
, who had seen 
twelve years se
rvice and was i
n civil life a 
postman. He had
 a special disl
ike for Kropp, 
Tjaden, Westhus
, and me, becau
se he sensed a 
quiet defiance.
 I have remade 
his bed fourtee
n times in one 
morning. Each t
ime he had some
 fault to find 
and pulled it t
o pieces. I hav
e kneaded a pai
r of prehistori
c boots that we
re as hard as i
ron for twenty 
hours--with int
ervals of cours
e--until they b
ecame as soft a
s butter and no
t even Himmelst
oss could find 
anything more t
o do to them; u
nder his orders
 I have scrubbe
d out the Corpo
rals' Mess with
 a tooth-brush.
 Kropp and I we
re given the jo
b of clearing t
he barrack-squa
re of snow with
 a hand-broom a
nd a dust-pan, 
and we would ha
ve gone on till
 we were frozen
 had not a lieu
tenant accident
ally appeared w
ho sent us off,
 and hauled Him
melstoss over t
he coals. But t
he only result 
of this was to 
make Himmelstos
s hate us more.
 For six weeks 
consecutively I
 did guard ever
y Sunday and wa
s hut-orderly f
or the same len
gth of time. Wi
th full pack an
d rifle I have 
had to practise
 on a soft, wet
, newly ploughe
d field the "Pr
epare to advanc
e, advance!" an
d the "Lie down
!" until I was 
one lump of mud
 and finally co
llapsed. Four h
ours later I ha
d to report to 
Himmelstoss wit
h my clothes sc
rubbed clean, m
y hands chafed 
and bleeding. T
ogether with Kr
opp, Westhus, a
nd Tjaden I hav
e stood at atte
ntion in a hard
 frost without 
gloves for a qu
arter of an hou
r at a stretch,
 while Himmelst
oss watched for
 the slightest 
movement of our
 bare fingers o
n the steel bar
rel of the rifl
e. I have run e
ight times from
 the top floor 
of the barracks
 down to the co
urtyard in my s
hirt at two o'c
lock in the mor
ning because my
 drawers projec
ted three inche
s beyond the ed
ge of the stool
 on which one h
ad to stack all
 one's things. 
Alongside me ra
n the corporal,
 Himmelstoss, a
nd trod on my b
are toes. At ba
yonet-practice 
I had constantl
y to fight with
 Himmelstoss, I
 with a heavy i
ron weapon whil
st he had a han
dy wooden one w
ith which he ea
sily struck my 
arms till they 
were black and 
blue. Once, ind
eed, I became s
o infuriated th
at I ran at him
 blindly and ga
ve him a mighty
 jab in the sto
mach and knocke
d him down. Whe
n he reported m
e the company c
ommander laughe
d at him and to
ld him he ought
 to keep his ey
es open; he und
erstood Himmels
toss, and appar
ently was not d
ispleased at hi
s discomfiture.
 I became a pas
t master on the
 parallel bars 
and strove to s
urpass my instr
uctor at physic
al jerks;--we h
ave trembled at
 the mere sound
 of his voice, 
but this runawa
y post-horse ne
ver got the bet
ter of us. One 
Sunday as Kropp
 and I were lug
ging a latrine-
bucket on a pol
e across the ba
rrack-yard, Him
melstoss came b
y, all polished
 up and spry fo
r going out. He
 planted himsel
f in front of u
s and asked how
 we liked the j
ob. In spite of
 ourselves we t
ripped and empt
ied the bucket 
over his legs. 
He raved, but t
he limit had be
en reached. "Th
at means clink,
" he yelled. Bu
t Kropp had had
 enough. "There
'll be an inqui
ry first," he s
aid, "and then 
we'll unload." 
"Mind how you s
peak to a non-c
ommissioned off
icer!" bawled H
immelstoss. "Ha
ve you lost you
r senses? You w
ait till you're
 spoken to. Wha
t will you do, 
anyway?" "Show 
you up, Corpora
l," said Kropp,
 his thumbs in 
line with the s
eams of his tro
users. Himmelst
oss saw what we
 meant and went
 off without sa
ying a word. Bu
t before he dis
appeared he gro
wled: "You'll d
rink this!"--bu
t it was the en
d of his author
ity. He tried i
t on once more 
in the ploughed
 field with his
 "Prepare to ad
vance, advance"
 and "Lie down.
" We obeyed eac
h order, since 
an order's an o
rder and has to
 be obeyed. But
 we did it so s
lowly that Himm
elstoss became 
desperate. Care
fully we went d
own on our knee
s, then on our 
hands, and so o
n; in the meant
ime, quite infu
riated, he had 
given another c
ommand. But bef
ore we had even
 begun to sweat
 he was hoarse.
 After that he 
left us in peac
e. He did indee
d always refer 
to us as swine,
 but there was,
 nevertheless, 
a certain respe
ct in his tone.
 There were man
y other staff c
orporals, the m
ajority of whom
 were more dece
nt. But above a
ll each of them
 wanted to keep
 his good job t
here at home as
 long as possib
le, and that he
 could do only 
by being strict
 with the recru
its. Practicall
y every conceiv
able polishing 
job in the enti
re camp fell to
 us and we ofte
n howled with r
age. Many of us
 became ill thr
ough it; Wolf a
ctually died of
 inflammation o
f the lung. But
 we would have 
felt ridiculous
 had we hauled 
down our colour
s. We became ha
rd, suspicious,
 pitiless, vici
ous, tough--and
 that was good;
 for these attr
ibutes had been
 entirely lacki
ng in us. Had w
e gone into the
 trenches witho
ut this period 
of training mos
t of us would c
ertainly have g
one mad. Only t
hus were we pre
pared for what 
awaited us. We 
did not break d
own, but endure
d; our twenty y
ears, which mad
e many another 
thing so grievo
us, helped us i
n this. But by 
far the most im
portant was tha
t it awakened i
n us a strong, 
practical sense
 of _esprit de 
corps_, which i
n the field dev
eloped into the
 finest thing t
hat arose out o
f the war--comr
adeship. * * I 
sit by Kemmeric
h's bed. He is 
sinking steadil
y. Around us is
 a great commot
ion. A hospital
 train has arri
ved and the wou
nded fit to be 
moved are being
 selected. The 
doctor passes b
y Kemmerich's b
ed without once
 looking at him
. "Next time, F
ranz," I say. H
e raises himsel
f on the pillow
 with his elbow
s. "They have a
mputated my leg
." He knows it 
too then. I nod
 and answer: "Y
ou must be than
kful you've com
e off with that
." He is silent
. I resume: "It
 might have bee
n both legs, Fr
anz. Wegeler ha
s lost his righ
t arm. That's m
uch worse. Besi
des, you will b
e going home." 
He looks at me.
 "Do you think 
so?" "Of course
." "Do you thin
k so?" he repea
ts. "Sure, Fran
z. Once you've 
got over the op
eration." He be
ckons me to ben
d down. I stoop
 over him and h
e whispers: "I 
don't think so.
" "Don't talk r
ubbish, Franz, 
in a couple of 
days you'll see
 for yourself. 
What is it anyw
ay--an amputate
d leg? here the
y patch up far 
worse things th
an that." He li
fts one hand. "
Look here thoug
h, these finger
s." "That's the
 result of the 
operation. Just
 eat decently a
nd you'll soon 
be well again. 
Do they look af
ter you properl
y?" He points t
o a dish that i
s still half fu
ll. I get excit
ed. "Franz, you
 must eat. Eati
ng is the main 
thing. That loo
ks good too." H
e turns away. A
fter a pause he
 says slowly: "
I wanted to bec
ome a head-fore
ster once." "So
 you may still,
" I assure him.
 "There are spl
endid artificia
l limbs now, yo
u'd hardly know
 there was anyt
hing missing. T
hey are fixed o
n to the muscle
s. You can move
 the fingers an
d work and even
 write with an 
artificial hand
. And besides, 
they will alway
s be making new
 improvements."
 For a while he
 lies still. Th
en he says: "Yo
u can take my l
ace-up boots wi
th you for Müll
er." I nod and 
wonder what to 
say to encourag
e him. His lips
 have fallen aw
ay, his mouth h
as become large
r, his teeth st
ick out and loo
k as though the
y were made of 
chalk. The fles
h melts, the fo
rehead bulges m
ore prominently
, the cheek-bon
es protrude. Th
e skeleton is w
orking itself t
hrough. The eye
s are already s
unken in. In a 
couple of hours
 it will be ove
r. He is not th
e first that I 
have seen thus;
 but we grew up
 together and t
hat always make
s it a bit diff
erent. I have c
opied his essay
s. At school he
 used to wear a
 brown coat wit
h a belt and sh
iny sleeves. He
 was the only o
ne of us, too, 
who could do th
e giant's turn 
on the horizont
al bar. His hai
r flew in his f
ace like silk w
hen he did it. 
Kantorek was pr
oud of him for 
it. But he coul
dn't endure cig
arettes. His sk
in was very whi
te; he had some
thing of the gi
rl about him. I
 glance at my b
oots. They are 
big and clumsy,
 the breeches a
re tucked into 
them, and stand
ing up one look
s well-built an
d powerful in t
hese great drai
n-pipes. But wh
en we go bathin
g and strip, su
ddenly we have 
slender legs ag
ain and slight 
shoulders. We a
re no longer so
ldiers but litt
le more than bo
ys; no one woul
d believe that 
we could carry 
packs. It is a 
strange moment 
when we stand n
aked; then we b
ecome civilians
, and almost fe
el ourselves to
 be so. When ba
thing Franz Kem
merich looked a
s slight and fr
ail as a child.
 There he lies 
now--but why? T
he whole world 
ought to pass b
y this bed and 
say: "That is F
ranz Kemmerich,
 nineteen and a
 half years old
, he doesn't wa
nt to die. Let 
him not die!" M
y thoughts beco
me confused. Th
is atmosphere o
f carbolic and 
gangrene clogs 
the lungs, it i
s a thick gruel
, it suffocates
. It grows dark
. Kemmerich's f
ace changes col
our, it lifts f
rom the pillow 
and is so pale 
that it gleams.
 The mouth move
s slightly. I d
raw near to him
. He whispers: 
"If you find my
 watch, send it
 home----" I do
 not reply. It 
is no use any m
ore. No one can
 console him. I
 am wretched wi
th helplessness
. This forehead
 with its hollo
w temples, this
 mouth that is 
now merely a sl
it, this sharp 
nose! And the f
at, weeping wom
an at home to w
hom I must writ
e. If only the 
letter were sen
t off already! 
Hospital-orderl
ies go to and f
ro with bottles
 and pails. One
 of them comes 
up, casts a gla
nce at Kemmeric
h and goes away
 again. You can
 see he is wait
ing, apparently
 he wants the b
ed. I bend over
 Franz and talk
 to him as thou
gh that could s
ave him: "Perha
ps you will go 
to the convales
cent home at Kl
osterberg, amon
g the villas, F
ranz. Then you 
can look out fr
om the window a
cross the field
s to the two tr
ees on the hori
zon. It is the 
loveliest time 
of the year now
, when the corn
 ripens; at eve
ning the fields
 in the sunligh
t look like mot
her-of-pearl. A
nd the lane of 
poplars by the 
Klosterbach, wh
ere we used to 
catch stickleba
cks! You can bu
ild an aquarium
 again and keep
 fish in it, an
d you can go ou
t without askin
g anyone, you c
an even play th
e piano if you 
want to." I lea
n down over his
 face which lie
s in the shadow
. He still brea
thes, lightly. 
His face is wet
, he is crying.
 What a fine me
ss I have made 
of it with my f
oolish talk! "B
ut Franz"--I pu
t my arm round 
his shoulder an
d put my face a
gainst his. "Wi
ll you sleep no
w?" He does not
 answer. The te
ars run down hi
s cheeks. I wou
ld like to wipe
 them away but 
my handkerchief
 is too dirty. 
An hour passes.
 I sit tensely 
and watch his e
very movement i
n case he may p
erhaps say some
thing. What if 
he were to open
 his mouth and 
cry out! But he
 only weeps, hi
s head turned a
side. He does n
ot speak of his
 mother or his 
brothers and si
sters. He says 
nothing; all th
at lies behind 
him; he is enti
rely alone now 
with his little
 life of ninete
en years, and c
ries because it
 leaves him. Th
is is the most 
disturbing and 
hardest parting
 that ever I ha
ve seen, althou
gh it was prett
y bad too with 
Tiedjen, who ca
lled for his mo
ther--a big bea
r of a fellow w
ho, with wild e
yes full of ter
ror, held off t
he doctor from 
his bed with a 
dagger until he
 collapsed. Sud
denly Kemmerich
 groans and beg
ins to gurgle. 
I jump up, stum
ble outside and
 demand: "Where
 is the doctor?
 Where is the d
octor?" As I ca
tch sight of th
e white apron I
 seize hold of 
it: "Come quick
, Franz Kemmeri
ch is dying." H
e frees himself
 and asks an or
derly standing 
by: "Which will
 that be?" He s
ays: "Bed 26, a
mputated thigh.
" He sniffs: "H
ow should I kno
w anything abou
t it, I've ampu
tated five legs
 to-day"; he sh
oves me away, s
ays to the hosp
ital-orderly "Y
ou see to it," 
and runs off to
 the operating 
room. I tremble
 with rage as I
 go along with 
the orderly. Th
e man looks at 
me and says: "O
ne operation af
ter another sin
ce five o'clock
 this morning. 
You know to-day
 alone there ha
ve been sixteen
 deaths--yours 
is the seventee
nth. There will
 probably be tw
enty altogether
----" I become 
faint, all at o
nce I cannot do
 any more. I wo
n't revile any 
more, it is sen
seless, I could
 drop down and 
never rise up a
gain. We are by
 Kemmerich's be
d. He is dead. 
The face is sti
ll wet from the
 tears. The eye
s are half open
 and yellow lik
e old horn butt
ons. The orderl
y pokes me in t
he ribs. "Are y
ou taking his t
hings with you?
" I nod. He goe
s on: "We must 
take him away a
t once, we want
 the bed. Outsi
de they are lyi
ng on the floor
." I collect th
e things, untie
 Kemmerich's id
entification di
sc and take it 
away. The order
ly asks about t
he pay-book, I 
say that it is 
probably in the
 orderly-room, 
and go. Behind 
me they are alr
eady hauling Fr
anz on to a wat
er-proof sheet.
 Outside the do
or I am aware o
f the darkness 
and the wind as
 a deliverance.
 I breathe as d
eep as I can, a
nd feel the bre
eze in my face,
 warm and soft 
as never before
. Thoughts of g
irls, of flower
y meadows, of w
hite clouds sud
denly come into
 my head. My fe
et begin to mov
e forward in my
 boots, I go qu
icker, I run. S
oldiers pass by
 me, I hear the
ir voices witho
ut understandin
g. The earth is
 streaming with
 forces which p
our into me thr
ough the soles 
of my feet. The
 night crackles
 electrically, 
the front thund
ers like a conc
ert of drums. M
y limbs move su
pply, I feel my
 joints strong,
 I breathe the 
air deeply. The
 night lives, I
 live. I feel a
 hunger, greate
r than comes fr
om the belly al
one. Müller sta
nds in front of
 the hut and wa
its for me. I g
ive him the boo
ts. We go in an
d he tries them
 on. They fit w
ell. He roots a
mong his suppli
es and offers m
e a fine piece 
of saveloy. Wit
h it goes hot t
ea and rum. CHA
PTER III Reinfo
rcements have a
rrived. The vac
ancies have bee
n filled and th
e sacks of stra
w are already l
aid out in the 
huts. Some of t
hem are old han
ds, but there a
re twenty-five 
men of a later 
draft from the 
base. They are 
about two years
 younger than u
s. Kropp nudges
 me: "Seen the 
infants?" I nod
. We stick out 
our chests, sha
ve in the open,
 shove our hand
s in our pocket
s, inspect the 
recruits and fe
el ourselves to
 be stone-age v
eterans. Katczi
nsky joins us. 
We stroll past 
the horse-boxes
 and go over to
 the reinforcem
ents, who have 
already been is
sued with gas-m
asks and coffee
. "Long time si
nce you've had 
anything decent
 to eat, eh?" K
at asks one of 
the youngsters.
 He grimaces. "
For breakfast, 
turnip-bread--l
unch, turnip-st
ew--supper, tur
nip-cutlets and
 turnip-salad."
 Kat gives a kn
owing whistle. 
"Bread made of 
turnips? You've
 been in luck, 
it's nothing ne
w for it to be 
made of sawdust
. But what do y
ou say to haric
ot beans? Have 
some?" The youn
gster turns red
: "You can't ki
d me." Katczins
ky merely says:
 "Fetch your me
ss-tin." We fol
low curiously. 
He takes us to 
a tub beside hi
s straw sack. I
t is nearly hal
f full of a ste
w of beef and b
eans. Katczinsk
y plants himsel
f in front of i
t like a genera
l and says: "Sh
arp eyes and li
ght fingers! Th
at's what the P
russians say." 
We are surprise
d. "Great guts,
 Kat, how did y
ou come by that
?" I ask him. "
Ginger was glad
 I took it. I g
ave him three p
ieces of parach
ute silk for it
. Cold beans ta
ste fine, too."
 Grudgingly he 
gives the young
ster a portion 
and says: "Next
 time you come 
with your mess-
tin have a ciga
r or a chew of 
tobacco in your
 other hand. Ge
t me?" Then he 
turns to us. "Y
ou get off scot
 free, of cours
e." * * Katczin
sky never goes 
short; he has a
 sixth sense. T
here are such p
eople everywher
e but one does 
not appreciate 
it at first. Ev
ery company has
 one or two. Ka
tczinsky is the
 smartest I kno
w. By trade he 
is a cobbler, I
 believe, but t
hat hasn't anyt
hing to do with
 it; he underst
ands all trades
. It's a good t
hing to be frie
nds with him, a
s Kropp and I a
re, and Haie We
sthus too, more
 or less. But H
aie is rather t
he executive ar
m operating und
er Kat's orders
 when things co
me to blows. Fo
r that he has h
is qualificatio
ns. For example
, we land at ni
ght in some ent
irely unknown s
pot, a sorry ho
le, that has be
en eaten out to
 the very walls
. We are quarte
red in a small 
dark factory ad
apted to the pu
rpose. There ar
e beds in it, o
r rather bunks-
-a couple of wo
oden beams over
 which wire net
ting is stretch
ed. Wire nettin
g is hard. And 
there's nothing
 to put on it. 
Our waterproof 
sheets are too 
thin. We use ou
r blankets to c
over ourselves.
 Kat looks at t
he place and th
en says to Haie
 Westhus: "Come
 with me." They
 go off to expl
ore. Half an ho
ur later they a
re back again w
ith arms full o
f straw. Kat ha
s found a horse
-box with straw
 in it. Now we 
might sleep if 
we weren't so t
erribly hungry.
 Kropp asks an 
artilleryman wh
o has been some
 time in this n
eighbourhood: "
Is there a cant
een anywhere ab
outs?" "Is ther
e a what?" he l
aughs. "There's
 nothing to be 
had here. You w
on't find so mu
ch as a crust o
f bread here." 
"Aren't there a
ny inhabitants 
here at all the
n?" He spits. "
Yes, a couple. 
But they mostly
 loaf round the
 cook house and
 beg." "That's 
a bad business!
--Then we'll ha
ve to pull in o
ur belts and wa
it till the rat
ions come up in
 the morning." 
But I see Kat h
as put on his c
ap. "Where to, 
Kat?" I ask. "J
ust to explore 
the place a bit
." He strolls o
ff. The artille
ryman grins sco
rnfully. "Let h
im explore! But
 don't be too h
opeful about it
." Disappointed
 we lie down an
d consider whet
her we couldn't
 have a go at t
he iron rations
. But it's too 
risky; so we tr
y to get a wink
 of sleep. Krop
p divides a cig
arette and hand
s me half. Tjad
en gives an acc
ount of his nat
ional dish--bro
ad-beans and ba
con. He despise
s it when not f
lavoured with b
og-myrtle, and,
 "for God's sak
e, let it all b
e cooked togeth
er, not the pot
atoes, the bean
s, and the baco
n separately." 
Someone growls 
that he will po
und Tjaden into
 bog-myrtle if 
he doesn't shut
 up. Then all b
ecomes quiet in
 the big room--
only the candle
s flickering fr
om the necks of
 a couple of bo
ttles and the a
rtilleryman spi
tting every now
 and then. We s
tir a bit as th
e door opens an
d Kat appears. 
I think I must 
be dreaming; he
 has two loaves
 of bread under
 his arm and a 
blood-stained s
andbag full of 
horse-flesh in 
his hand. The a
rtilleryman's p
ipe drops from 
his mouth. He f
eels the bread.
 "Real bread, b
y God! and stil
l hot too!" Kat
 gives no expla
nation. He has 
the bread, the 
rest doesn't ma
tter. I'm sure 
that if he were
 planted down i
n the middle of
 the desert, in
 half an hour h
e would have ga
thered together
 a supper of ro
ast meat, dates
, and wine. "Cu
t some wood," h
e says curtly t
o Haie. Then he
 hauls out a fr
ying-pan from u
nder his coat, 
and a handful o
f salt as well 
as a lump of fa
t from his pock
et. He has thou
ght of everythi
ng. Haie makes 
a fire on the f
loor. It lights
 up the empty r
oom of the fact
ory. We climb o
ut of bed. The 
artilleryman he
sitates. He won
ders whether to
 praise Kat and
 so perhaps gai
n a little for 
himself. But Ka
tczinsky doesn'
t even see him,
 he might as we
ll be thin air.
 He goes off cu
rsing. Kat know
s the way to ro
ast horse-flesh
 so that it's t
ender. It shoul
dn't be put str
aight into the 
pan, that makes
 it tough. It s
hould be boiled
 first in a lit
tle water. With
 our knives we 
squat round in 
a circle and fi
ll our bellies.
 That is Kat. I
f for but one h
our in a year s
omething eatabl
e were to be ha
d in some one p
lace only, with
in that hour, a
s if moved by a
 vision, he wou
ld put on his c
ap, go out and 
walk directly t
here, as though
 following a co
mpass, and find
 it. He finds e
verything--if i
t is cold, a sm
all stove and w
ood, hay and st
raw, a table an
d chairs--but a
bove all food. 
It is uncanny; 
one would think
 he conjured it
 out of the air
. His masterpie
ce was four box
es of lobsters.
 Admittedly we 
would rather ha
ve had a good b
eef steak. * * 
We have settled
 ourselves on t
he sunny side o
f the hut. Ther
e is a smell of
 tar, of summer
, and of sweaty
 feet. Kat sits
 beside me. He 
wants to talk. 
To-day we have 
been practising
 saluting becau
se Tjaden faile
d to salute a m
ajor. Kat can't
 get it out of 
his head. "You 
see, we are los
ing the war bec
ause we can sal
ute too well," 
he says. Kropp 
stalks up, with
 his breeches r
olled up and hi
s feet bare. He
 lays out his w
ashed socks to 
dry on the gras
s. Kat turns hi
s eyes to heave
n, lets off a m
ighty fart, and
 says apologeti
cally: "Every l
ittle bean must
 be heard as we
ll as seen." Th
e two begin to 
argue. At the s
ame time they l
ay a bottle of 
beer on the res
ult of an air-f
ight that's goi
ng on above us.
 Katczinsky won
't budge from t
he opinion, whi
ch as an old Fr
ont-hog, he rhy
mes: Give 'em a
ll the same gru
b and all the s
ame pay And the
 war would be o
ver and done in
 a day. Kropp o
n the other han
d is a thinker.
 He proposes th
at a declaratio
n of war should
 be a kind of p
opular festival
 with entrance-
tickets and ban
ds, like a bull
 fight. Then in
 the arena the 
ministers and g
enerals of the 
two countries, 
dressed in bath
ing-drawers and
 armed with clu
bs, can have it
 out among them
selves. Whoever
 survives, his 
country wins. T
hat would be mu
ch simpler and 
more just than 
this arrangemen
t, where the wr
ong people do t
he fighting. Th
e subject is dr
opped. Then the
 conversation t
urns to drill. 
A picture comes
 before me. Bur
ning midday in 
the barrack-yar
d. The heat han
gs over the squ
are. The barrac
ks are deserted
. Everything sl
eeps. All one h
ears is the dru
mmers practisin
g; they have in
stalled themsel
ves anywhere an
d practise brok
enly, dully, mo
notonously. Wha
t a concord! Mi
dday heat, barr
ack-square, and
 drummers beati
ng! The windows
 of the barrack
s are empty and
 dark. From som
e of them trous
ers are hanging
 to dry. The ro
oms are cool an
d one looks tow
ard them longin
gly. O dark, mu
sty platoon hut
s, with the iro
n bedsteads, th
e chequered bed
ding, the locke
rs and the stoo
ls! Even you ca
n become the ob
ject of desire;
 out here you h
ave a faint res
emblance to hom
e; your rooms, 
full of the sme
ll of stale foo
d, sleep, smoke
, and clothes! 
Katczinsky pain
ts it all in li
vely colours. W
hat would we no
t give to be ab
le to go back t
o it! But we mu
st not pursue t
hat line of tho
ught any furthe
r. Those early 
morning hours o
f instruction--
"What are the p
arts of the 98 
rifle?"--the mi
dday hours of p
hysical trainin
g--"Pianist, fo
rward! By the r
ight, quick mar
ch. Report to t
he cook-house f
or potato-peeli
ng." We indulge
 in reminiscenc
es. Kropp laugh
s suddenly and 
says: "Change a
t Löhne!" That 
was our corpora
l's favourite g
ame. Löhne is a
 railway juncti
on. In order th
at our fellows 
going on leave 
shouldn't get l
ost there, Himm
elstoss used to
 practise the c
hange in the ba
rrack-room. We 
had to learn th
at at Löhne, to
 reach the bran
ch-line, we mus
t pass through 
a subway. The b
eds represented
 the subway and
 each man stood
 at attention o
n the left side
 of his bed. Th
en came the com
mand: "Change a
t Löhne!" and l
ike lightning e
veryone scrambl
ed under the be
d to the opposi
te side. We pra
ctised this for
 a whole hour--
-- Meanwhile th
e German aeropl
ane has been sh
ot down. Like a
 comet it burst
s into a stream
er of smoke and
 falls headlong
. Kropp has los
t the bottle of
 beer. Disgrunt
led he counts o
ut the money fr
om his wallet. 
"Surely Himmels
toss was a very
 different fell
ow as a postman
," say I, after
 Albert's disap
pointment has s
ubsided. "Then 
how does it com
e that he's suc
h a bully as a 
drill-sergeant?
" The question 
revives Kropp, 
more particular
ly as he hears 
there's no more
 beer in the ca
nteen. "It's no
t only Himmelst
oss, there are 
lots of them. A
s sure as they 
get a stripe or
 a star they be
come different 
men, just as th
ough they'd swa
llowed concrete
." "That's the 
uniform," I sug
gest. "Roughly 
speaking it is,
" says Kat, and
 prepares for a
 long speech; "
but the root of
 the matter lie
s elsewhere. Fo
r instance, if 
you train a dog
 to eat potatoe
s and then afte
rwards put a pi
ece of meat in 
front of him, h
e'll snap at it
, it's his natu
re. And if you 
give a man a li
ttle bit of aut
hority he behav
es just the sam
e way, he snaps
 at it too. The
 things are pre
cisely the same
. In himself ma
n is essentiall
y a beast, only
 he butters it 
over like a sli
ce of bread wit
h a little deco
rum. The army i
s based on that
; one man must 
always have pow
er over the oth
er. The mischie
f is merely tha
t each one has 
much too much p
ower. A non-com
. can torment a
 private, a lie
utenant a non-c
om., a captain 
a lieutenant, u
ntil he goes ma
d. And because 
they know they 
can, they all s
oon acquire the
 habit more or 
less. Take a si
mple case: we a
re marching bac
k from the para
de-ground dog-t
ired. Then come
s the order to 
sing. We are gl
ad enough to be
 able to trail 
arms but we sin
g spiritlessly.
 At once the co
mpany is turned
 about and has 
to do another h
our's drill as 
punishment. On 
the march back 
the order to si
ng is given aga
in, and once mo
re we start. No
w what's the us
e of all that? 
It's simply tha
t the company c
ommander's head
 has been turne
d by having so 
much power. And
 nobody blames 
him. On the con
trary, he is pr
aised for being
 strict. That, 
of course, is o
nly a trifling 
instance, but i
t holds also in
 very different
 affairs. Now I
 ask you: Let a
 man be whateve
r you like in p
eace-time, what
 occupation is 
there in which 
he can behave l
ike that withou
t getting a cra
ck on the nose?
 He can only do
 that in the ar
my. It goes to 
the heads of th
em all, you see
. And the more 
insignificant a
 man has been i
n civil life th
e worse it take
s him." "They s
ay, of course, 
there must be d
iscipline," ven
tures Kropp med
itatively. "Tru
e," growls Kat,
 "they always d
o. And it may b
e so; still it 
oughtn't to bec
ome an abuse. B
ut you try to e
xplain that to 
a blacksmith or
 a labourer or 
a workman, you 
try to make tha
t clear to a si
mple tommy--and
 that's what mo
st of them are 
here. All he un
derstands is th
at he has been 
properly traine
d so that when 
he comes up to 
the front he th
inks he knows e
xactly what he 
should do in ev
ery circumstanc
e and what not.
 It's simply am
azing, I tell y
ou, that the or
dinary soldier 
survives so lon
g up here in th
e front-line. S
imply amazing!"
 No one protest
s. Everyone kno
ws that drill c
eases only in t
he front-line a
nd begins again
 a few miles be
hind, with all 
the absurdities
 of saluting an
d parade. It is
 an iron law th
at the soldier 
must be employe
d under every c
ircumstance. He
re Tjaden comes
 up with a flus
hed face. He is
 so excited tha
t he stutters. 
Beaming with sa
tisfaction he s
tammers out: "H
immelstoss is o
n his way. He's
 coming to the 
front!" * * Tja
den has a speci
al grudge again
st Himmelstoss,
 because of the
 way he educate
d him in the ba
rracks. Tjaden 
wets his bed, h
e does it at ni
ght in his slee
p. Himmelstoss 
maintained that
 it was sheer l
aziness and inv
ented a method 
worthy of himse
lf for curing T
jaden. He hunte
d up another pi
ss-a-bed, named
 Kindervater, f
rom a neighbour
ing hut, and qu
artered him wit
h Tjaden. In th
e huts there we
re the usual bu
nks, one above 
the other in pa
irs, with mattr
esses of wire-n
etting. Himmels
toss put these 
two so that one
 occupied the u
pper and the ot
her the lower b
unk. The man un
derneath was of
 course disgust
ed. The next ni
ght they were c
hanged over and
 the lower one 
put on top so t
hat he could re
taliate. That w
as Himmelstoss'
s system of sel
f-education. Th
e idea was low 
but not ill-con
ceived. Unfortu
nately it accom
plished nothing
 because the fi
rst assumption 
was wrong: it w
as not laziness
 in either of t
hem. Anyone who
 looked at thei
r sallow skin c
ould see that. 
The matter ende
d in one of the
m always sleepi
ng on the floor
, where he freq
uently caught c
old. Meanwhile 
Haie sits down 
beside us. He w
inks at me and 
rubs his paws t
houghtfully. We
 once spent the
 finest day of 
our army-life t
ogether--the da
y before we lef
t for the front
. We had been a
llotted to one 
of the recently
 formed regimen
ts, but were fi
rst to be sent 
back for equipm
ent to the garr
ison, not to th
e reinforcement
-depot, of cour
se, but to anot
her barracks. W
e were due to l
eave next morni
ng early. In th
e evening we pr
epared ourselve
s to square acc
ounts with Himm
elstoss. We had
 sworn for week
s past to do th
is. Kropp had e
ven gone so far
 as to propose 
entering the po
stal service in
 peace-time in 
order to be Him
melstoss's supe
rior when he be
came a postman 
again. He revel
led in the thou
ght of how he w
ould grind him.
 It was this th
at made it impo
ssible for him 
to crush us alt
ogether--we alw
ays reckoned th
at later, at th
e end of the wa
r, we would hav
e our revenge o
n him. In the m
eantime we deci
ded to give him
 a good hiding.
 What could he 
do to us anyhow
 if he didn't r
ecognize us and
 we left early 
the next mornin
g? We knew whic
h pub he used t
o visit every e
vening. Returni
ng to the barra
cks he had to g
o along a dark,
 uninhabited ro
ad. There we wa
ited for him be
hind a pile of 
stones. I had a
 bed-cover with
 me. We tremble
d with suspense
, hoping he wou
ld be alone. At
 last we heard 
his footstep, w
hich we recogni
zed easily, so 
often had we he
ard it in the m
ornings as the 
door flew open 
and he bawled: 
"Get up!" "Alon
e?" whispered K
ropp. "Alone." 
I slipped round
 the pile of st
ones with Tjade
n. Himmelstoss 
seemed a little
 elevated; he w
as singing. His
 belt-buckle gl
eamed. He came 
on unsuspecting
ly. We seized t
he bed-cover, m
ade a quick lea
p, threw it ove
r his head from
 behind and pul
led it round hi
m so that he st
ood there in a 
white sack unab
le to raise his
 arms. The sing
ing stopped. Th
e next moment H
aie Westhus was
 there, and spr
eading out his 
arms he shoved 
us back in orde
r to be first i
n. He put himse
lf in position 
with evident sa
tisfaction, rai
sed his arm lik
e a signal-mast
 and his hand l
ike a coal-shov
el and fetched 
such a blow on 
the white sack 
as would have f
elled an ox. Hi
mmelstoss was t
hrown down, he 
rolled five yar
ds and started 
to yell. But we
 were prepared 
for that and ha
d brought a cus
hion. Haie squa
tted down, laid
 the cushion on
 his knees, fel
t where Himmels
toss's head was
 and pressed it
 down on the pi
llow. Immediate
ly his voice wa
s muffled. Haie
 let him get a 
gasp of air eve
ry so often, wh
en he would giv
e a mighty yell
 that was immed
iately hushed. 
Tjaden unbutton
ed Himmelstoss'
s braces and pu
lled down his t
rousers, holdin
g the whip mean
time in his tee
th. Then he sto
od up and set t
o work. It was 
a wonderful pic
ture: Himmelsto
ss on the groun
d; Haie bending
 over him with 
a fiendish grin
 and his mouth 
open with blood
-lust, Himmelst
oss's head on h
is knees; then 
the convulsed, 
striped drawers
, the knock kne
es, executing a
t every blow mo
st original mov
ements in the l
owered breeches
, and towering 
over them like 
a woodcutter th
e indefatigable
 Tjaden. In the
 end we had to 
drag him away t
o get our turn.
 Finally Haie s
tood Himmelstos
s on his feet a
gain and gave o
ne last persona
l remonstrance.
 As he stretche
d out his right
 arm preparator
y to giving him
 a box on the e
ar he looked as
 if he were goi
ng to reach dow
n a star. Himme
lstoss staggere
d. Haie stood h
im up again, ma
de ready and fe
tched him a sec
ond, well-aimed
 beauty with th
e left hand. Hi
mmelstoss yelle
d and fell down
 on all fours c
ursing. His str
iped postman's 
backside gleame
d in the moonli
ght. We disappe
ared at full sp
eed. Haie looke
d round once ag
ain and said wr
athfully, satis
fied and rather
 mysteriously: 
"Revenge is bla
ck-pudding." Hi
mmelstoss ought
 to have been p
leased; his say
ing that we sho
uld each educat
e one another h
ad borne fruit 
for himself. We
 had become suc
cessful student
s of his method
. He never disc
overed whom he 
had to thank fo
r the business.
 At any rate he
 scored a bed-c
over out of it;
 for when we re
turned a few ho
urs later to lo
ok for it, it w
as no longer to
 be found. That
 evening's work
 made us more o
r less content 
to leave next m
orning. And an 
old buffer was 
pleased to desc
ribe us as "you
ng heroes." CHA
PTER IV We have
 to go up on wi
ring fatigue. T
he motor lorrie
s roll up after
 dark. We climb
 in. It is a wa
rm evening and 
the twilight se
ems like a cano
py under whose 
shelter we feel
 drawn together
. Even the stin
gy Tjaden gives
 me a cigarette
 and then a lig
ht. We stand ja
mmed in togethe
r, shoulder to 
shoulder, there
 is no room to 
sit. But we do 
not expect that
. Müller is in 
a good mood for
 once; he is we
aring his new b
oots. The engin
es drone, the l
orries bump and
 rattle. The ro
ads are worn an
d full of holes
. We dare not s
how a light so 
we lurch along 
and are often a
lmost pitched o
ut. That does n
ot worry us, ho
wever. It can h
appen if it lik
es; a broken ar
m is better tha
n a hole in the
 guts, and many
 a man would be
 thankful enoug
h for such a ch
ance of finding
 his way home a
gain. Beside us
 stream the mun
ition-columns i
n long files. T
hey are making 
the pace, they 
overtake us goi
ng forward. We 
joke with them 
and they answer
 back. A wall b
ecomes visible,
 it belongs to 
a house which l
ies on the side
 of the road. I
 suddenly prick
 up my ears. Am
 I deceived? Ag
ain I hear dist
inctly the cack
le of geese. A 
glance at Katcz
insky--a glance
 from him to me
; we understand
 one another. "
Kat, I hear som
e aspirants for
 the frying-pan
 over there." H
e nods. "It wil
l be attended t
o when we come 
back. I have th
eir number." Of
 course Kat has
 their number. 
He knows all ab
out every leg o
f goose within 
a radius of fif
teen miles. The
 lorries arrive
 at the artille
ry lines. The g
un-emplacements
 are camouflage
d with bushes a
gainst aerial o
bservation, and
 look like a ki
nd of military 
Feast of the Ta
bernacles. Thes
e branches migh
t seem gay and 
cheerful were n
ot cannon embow
ered there. The
 air becomes ac
rid with the sm
oke of the guns
 and the fog. T
he fumes of pow
der taste bitte
r on the tongue
. The roar of t
he guns makes o
ur lorry stagge
r, the reverber
ation rolls rag
ing away to the
 rear, everythi
ng quakes. Our 
faces change im
perceptibly. We
 are not, indee
d, in the front
-line, but only
 in the reserve
s, yet in every
 face can be re
ad: This is the
 Front, now we 
are within its 
embrace. It is 
not fear. Men w
ho have been up
 as often as we
 have become th
ick skinned. On
ly the young re
cruits are agit
ated. Kat expla
ins to them: "T
hat was a twelv
e-inch. You hea
r the explosion
 first and afte
rwards comes th
e sound of the 
gun." But the h
ollow sound of 
the firing does
 not reach us. 
It is swallowed
 up in the gene
ral murmur of t
he front. Kat l
istens: "There'
ll be a bombard
ment to-night."
 We all listen.
 The front is r
estless. "The T
ommies are firi
ng already," sa
ys Kropp. The s
helling can be 
heard distinctl
y. It is the En
glish batteries
 to the right o
f our section. 
They are beginn
ing an hour too
 soon. Accordin
g to us they st
art punctually 
at ten o'clock.
 "What's got th
em?" says Mülle
r, "their clock
s must be fast.
" "There'll be 
a bombardment, 
I tell you, I c
an feel it in m
y bones." Kat s
hrugs his shoul
ders. Three she
lls land beside
 us. The burst 
of flame shoots
 across the fog
, the fragments
 howl and drone
. We shiver and
 are glad to th
ink that we sha
ll be back in t
he huts early i
n the morning. 
Our faces are n
either paler no
r more flushed 
than usual; the
y are not more 
tense nor more 
flabby--and yet
 they are chang
ed. We feel tha
t in our blood 
a contact has s
hot home. That 
is no figure of
 speech; it is 
fact. It is the
 front, the con
sciousness of t
he front, that 
makes this cont
act. The moment
 that the first
 shells whistle
 over and the a
ir is rent with
 the explosions
 there is sudde
nly in our vein
s, in our hands
, in our eyes a
 tense waiting,
 a watching, a 
heightened aler
tness, a strang
e sharpening of
 the senses. Th
e body with one
 bound is in fu
ll readiness. I
t often seems t
o me as though 
it were the vib
rating, shudder
ing air that wi
th a noiseless 
leap springs up
on us; or as th
ough the front 
itself emitted 
an electric cur
rent which awak
ened unknown ne
rve-centres. Ev
ery time it is 
the same. We st
art out for the
 front plain so
ldiers, either 
cheerful or glo
omy: then come 
the first gun-e
mplacements and
 every word of 
our speech has 
a new ring. Whe
n Kat stands in
 front of the h
ut and says: "T
here'll be a bo
mbardment," tha
t is merely his
 own opinion; b
ut if he says i
t here, then th
e sentence has 
the sharpness o
f a bayonet in 
the moonlight, 
it cuts clean t
hrough the thou
ght, it thrusts
 nearer and spe
aks to this unk
nown thing that
 is awakened in
 us, a dark mea
ning--"There'll
 be a bombardme
nt." Perhaps it
 is our inner a
nd most secret 
life that shive
rs and falls on
 guard. * * To 
me the front is
 a mysterious w
hirlpool. Thoug
h I am in still
 water far away
 from its centr
e, I feel the w
hirl of the vor
tex sucking me 
slowly, irresis
tibly, inescapa
bly into itself
. From the eart
h, from the air
, sustaining fo
rces pour into 
us--mostly from
 the earth. To 
no man does the
 earth mean so 
much as to the 
soldier. When h
e presses himse
lf down upon he
r long and powe
rfully, when he
 buries his fac
e and his limbs
 deep in her fr
om the fear of 
death by shell-
fire, then she 
is his only fri
end, his brothe
r, his mother; 
he stifles his 
terror and his 
cries in her si
lence and her s
ecurity; she sh
elters him and 
gives him a new
 lease of ten s
econds of life,
 receives him a
gain and often 
for ever. Earth
!--Earth!--Eart
h! Earth with t
hy folds, and h
ollows and hole
s, into which a
 man may fling 
himself and cro
uch down! In th
e spasm of terr
or, under the h
ailing of annih
ilation, in the
 bellowing deat
h of the explos
ions, O Earth, 
thou grantest u
s the great res
isting surge of
 new-won life. 
Our being, almo
st utterly carr
ied away by the
 fury of the st
orm, streams ba
ck through our 
hands from thee
, and we, thy r
edeemed ones, b
ury ourselves i
n thee, and thr
ough the long m
inutes in a mut
e agony of hope
 bite into thee
 with our lips!
 At the sound o
f the first dro
ning of the she
lls we rush bac
k, in one part 
of our being, a
 thousand years
. By the animal
 instinct that 
is awakened in 
us we are led a
nd protected. I
t is not consci
ous; it is far 
quicker, much m
ore sure, less 
fallible, than 
consciousness. 
One cannot expl
ain it. A man i
s walking along
 without though
t or heed;--sud
denly he throws
 himself down o
n the ground an
d a storm of fr
agments flies h
armlessly over 
him;--yet he ca
nnot remember e
ither to have h
eard the shell 
coming or to ha
ve thought of f
linging himself
 down. But had 
he not abandone
d himself to th
e impulse he wo
uld now be a he
ap of mangled f
lesh. It is thi
s other, this s
econd sight in 
us, that has th
rown us to the 
ground and save
d us, without o
ur knowing how.
 If it were not
 so, there woul
d not be one ma
n alive from Fl
anders to the V
osges. We march
 up, moody or g
ood-tempered so
ldiers--we reac
h the zone wher
e the front beg
ins and become 
on the instant 
human animals. 
* * An indigent
 looking wood r
eceives us. We 
pass by the sou
p-kitchens. Und
er cover of the
 wood we climb 
out. The lorrie
s turn back. Th
ey are to colle
ct us again in 
the morning, be
fore dawn. Mist
 and the smoke 
of guns lie bre
ast-high over t
he fields. The 
moon is shining
. Along the roa
d troops file. 
Their helmets g
leam softly in 
the moonlight. 
The heads and t
he rifles stand
 out above the 
white mist, nod
ding heads, roc
king carriers o
f guns. Farther
 on the mist en
ds. Here the he
ads become figu
res; coats, tro
users, and boot
s appear out of
 the mist as fr
om a milky pool
. They become a
 column. The co
lumn marches on
, straight ahea
d, the figures 
resolve themsel
ves into a bloc
k, individuals 
are no longer r
ecognizable, th
e dark wedge pr
esses onward, f
antastically to
pped by the hea
ds and weapons 
floating off on
 the milky pool
. A column--not
 men at all. Gu
ns and munition
 wagons are mov
ing along a cro
ss-road. The ba
cks of the hors
es shine in the
 moonlight, the
ir movements ar
e beautiful, th
ey toss their h
eads, and their
 eyes gleam. Th
e guns and the 
wagons float be
fore the dim ba
ckground of the
 moonlit landsc
ape, the riders
 in their steel
 helmets resemb
le knights of a
 forgotten time
; it is strange
ly beautiful an
d arresting. We
 push on to the
 pioneer dump. 
Some of us load
 our shoulders 
with pointed an
d twisted iron 
stakes; others 
thrust smooth i
ron rods throug
h rolls of wire
 and go off wit
h them. The bur
dens are awkwar
d and heavy. Th
e ground become
s more broken. 
From ahead come
 warnings: "Loo
k out, deep she
ll-hole on the 
left"--"Mind, t
renches"---- Ou
r eyes peer out
, our feet and 
our sticks feel
 in front of us
 before they ta
ke the weight o
f the body. Sud
denly the line 
halts; I bump m
y face against 
the roll of wir
e carried by th
e man in front 
and curse. Ther
e are some shel
l-smashed lorri
es in the road.
 Another order:
 "Cigarettes an
d pipes out," W
e are getting n
ear the line. I
n the meantime 
it has become p
itch dark. We s
kirt a small wo
od and then hav
e the front lin
e immediately b
efore us. An un
certain, red gl
ow spreads alon
g the sky line 
from one end to
 the other. It 
is in perpetual
 movement, punc
tuated with the
 bursts of flam
e from the muzz
les of the batt
eries. Balls of
 light rise up 
high above it, 
silver and red 
spheres which e
xplode and rain
 down in shower
s of red, white
, and green sta
rs. French rock
ets go up, whic
h unfold a silk
 parachute to t
he air and drif
t slowly down. 
They light up e
verything as br
ight as day, th
eir light shine
s on us and we 
see our shadows
 sharply outlin
ed on the groun
d. They hover f
or the space of
 a minute befor
e they burn out
. Immediately f
resh ones shoot
 up to the sky,
 and again gree
n, red, and blu
e stars. "Bomba
rdment," says K
at. The thunder
 of the guns sw
ells to a singl
e heavy roar an
d then breaks u
p again into se
parate explosio
ns. The dry bur
sts of the mach
ine-guns rattle
. Above us the 
air teems with 
invisible swift
 movement, with
 howls, pipings
, and hisses. T
hey are the sma
ller shells;--a
nd amongst them
, booming throu
gh the night li
ke an organ, go
 the great coal
-boxes and the 
heavies. They h
ave a hoarse, d
istant bellow l
ike a rutting s
tag and make th
eir way high ab
ove the howl an
d whistle of th
e smaller shell
s. It reminds m
e of flocks of 
wild geese when
 I hear them. L
ast autumn the 
wild geese flew
 day after day 
across the path
 of the shells.
 The searchligh
ts begin to swe
ep the dark sky
. They slide al
ong it like gig
antic tapering 
rulers. One of 
them pauses, an
d quivers a lit
tle. Immediatel
y a second is b
eside him, a bl
ack insect is c
aught between t
hem and tries t
o escape--the a
irman. He hesit
ates, is blinde
d and falls. * 
* At regular in
tervals we ram 
in the iron sta
kes. Two men ho
ld a roll and t
he others spool
 off the barbed
 wire. It is th
at awful stuff 
with close-set,
 long spikes. I
 am not used to
 unrolling it a
nd tear my hand
. After a few h
ours it is done
. But there is 
still some time
 before the lor
ries come. Most
 of us lie down
 and sleep. I t
ry also, but it
 has turned too
 chilly. Near t
o the sea one i
s constantly wa
ked by the cold
. Once I fall f
ast asleep. The
n waking sudden
ly with a start
 I do not know 
where I am. I s
ee the stars, I
 see the rocket
s, and for a mo
ment have the i
mpression that 
I have fallen a
sleep at a gard
en fête. I don'
t know whether 
it is morning o
r evening, I li
e in the pale c
radle of the tw
ilight, and lis
ten for soft wo
rds which will 
come, soft and 
near--am I cryi
ng? I put my ha
nd to my eyes, 
it is so fantas
tic, am I a chi
ld? Smooth skin
:--it lasts onl
y a second, the
n I recognize t
he silhouette o
f Katczinsky. T
he old veteran,
 he sits quietl
y and smokes hi
s pipe--a cover
ed pipe of cour
se. When he see
s I am awake, h
e says: "That g
ave you a frigh
t. It was only 
a nose-cap, it 
landed in the b
ushes over ther
e." I sit up, I
 feel myself st
rangely alone. 
It's good Kat i
s there. He gaz
es thoughtfully
 at the front a
nd says: "Might
y fine fire-wor
ks if they were
n't so dangerou
s." One lands b
ehind us. Two r
ecruits jump up
 terrified. A c
ouple of minute
s later another
 comes over, ne
arer this time.
 Kat knocks out
 his pipe. "It 
makes a glow." 
Then it begins 
in earnest. We 
crawl away as w
ell as we can i
n our haste. Th
e next lands fa
ir among us. Tw
o fellows cry o
ut. Green rocke
ts shoot up on 
the sky-line. B
arrage. The mud
 flies high, fr
agments whizz p
ast. The crack 
of the guns is 
heard long afte
r the roar of t
he explosions. 
Beside us lies 
a fair-headed r
ecruit in utter
 terror. He has
 buried his fac
e in his hands,
 his helmet has
 fallen off. I 
fish hold of it
 and try to put
 it back on his
 head. He looks
 up, pushes the
 helmet off and
 like a child c
reeps under my 
arm, his head c
lose to my brea
st. The little 
shoulders heave
. Shoulders jus
t like Kemmeric
h's. I let him 
be. So that the
 helmet should 
be of some use 
I stick it on h
is behind;--not
 for a jest, bu
t out of consid
eration, since 
that is his hig
hest part. And 
though there is
 plenty of meat
 there, a shot 
in it can be da
mned painful. B
esides, a man h
as to lie a who
le month on his
 belly in the h
ospital, and af
terwards he wou
ld be almost su
re to have a li
mp. It's got so
meone pretty ba
dly. Cries are 
heard between t
he explosions. 
At last it grow
s quiet. The fi
re has lifted o
ver us and is n
ow dropping on 
the reserves. W
e risk a look. 
Red rockets sho
ot up to the sk
y. Apparently t
here's an attac
k coming. Where
 we are it is s
till quiet. I s
it up and shake
 the recruit by
 the shoulder. 
"All over, kid!
 It's all right
 this time." He
 looks round hi
m dazedly. "You
'll get used to
 it soon," I te
ll him. He sees
 his helmet and
 puts it on. Gr
adually he come
s to. Then sudd
enly he turns f
iery red and lo
oks confused. C
autiously he re
aches his hand 
to his behind a
nd looks at me 
dismally. I und
erstand at once
: Gun-shy. That
 wasn't the rea
son I had stuck
 his helmet ove
r it. "That's n
o disgrace," I 
reassure him: "
Many's the man 
before you has 
had his pants f
ull after the f
irst bombardmen
t. Go behind th
at bush there a
nd throw your u
nderpants away.
 Get along----"
 * * He goes of
f. Things becom
e quieter, but 
the cries do no
t cease. "What'
s up, Albert?" 
I ask. "A coupl
e of columns ov
er there have g
ot it in the ne
ck." The cries 
continue. It is
 not men, they 
could not cry s
o terribly. "Wo
unded horses," 
says Kat. It's 
unendurable. It
 is the moaning
 of the world, 
it is the marty
red creation, w
ild with anguis
h, filled with 
terror, and gro
aning. We are p
ale. Detering s
tands up. "God!
 For God's sake
! Shoot them!" 
He is a farmer 
and very fond o
f horses. It ge
ts under his sk
in. Then as if 
deliberately th
e fire dies dow
n again. The sc
reaming of the 
beasts becomes 
louder. One can
 no longer dist
inguish whence 
in this now qui
et, silvery lan
dscape it comes
; ghostly, invi
sible, it is ev
erywhere, betwe
en heaven and e
arth it rolls o
n immeasurably.
 Detering raves
 and yells out:
 "Shoot them! S
hoot them, can'
t you? damn you
 again!" "They 
must look after
 the men first,
" says Kat quie
tly. We stand u
p and try to se
e where it is. 
If we could onl
y see the anima
ls we should be
 able to endure
 it better. Mül
ler has a pair 
of glasses. We 
see a dark grou
p, bearers with
 stretchers, an
d larger black 
clumps moving a
bout. Those are
 the wounded ho
rses. But not a
ll of them. Som
e gallop away i
n the distance,
 fall down, and
 then run on fa
rther. The bell
y of one is rip
ped open, the g
uts trail out. 
He becomes tang
led in them and
 falls, then he
 stands up agai
n. Detering rai
ses his gun and
 aims. Kat hits
 it up in the a
ir. "Are you ma
d----?" Deterin
g trembles and 
throws his rifl
e on the ground
. We sit down a
nd hold our ear
s. But this app
alling noise, t
hese groans and
 screams penetr
ate, they penet
rate everywhere
. We can bear a
lmost anything.
 But now the sw
eat breaks out 
on us. We must 
get up and run,
 no matter wher
e, but where th
ese cries can n
o longer be hea
rd. And it is n
ot men, only ho
rses. From the 
dark group stre
tchers move off
 again. Then si
ngle shots crac
k out. The blac
k heap is convu
lsed and become
s thinner. At l
ast! But still 
it is not the e
nd. The men can
not overtake th
e wounded beast
s which fly in 
their pain, the
ir wide open mo
uths full of an
guish. One of t
he men goes dow
n on his knee, 
a shot--one hor
se drops--anoth
er. The last on
e props himself
 on his foreleg
s and drags him
self round in a
 circle like a 
merry-go-round;
 squatting, it 
drags round in 
circles on its 
stiffened forel
egs, apparently
 its back is br
oken. The soldi
er runs up and 
shoots it. Slow
ly, humbly it s
inks to the gro
und. We take ou
r hands from ou
r ears. The cri
es are silenced
. Only a long-d
rawn, dying sig
h still hangs o
n the air. Then
 again only the
 rockets, the s
inging of the s
hells, and the 
stars--and they
 shine out wond
erfully. Deteri
ng walks up and
 down cursing: 
"Like to know w
hat harm they'v
e done." He ret
urns to it once
 again. His voi
ce is agitated,
 it sounds almo
st dignified as
 he says: "I te
ll you it is th
e vilest basene
ss to use horse
s in the war." 
* * We go back.
 It is time we 
returned to the
 lorries. The s
ky is become a 
bit brighter. T
hree o'clock in
 the morning. T
he breeze is fr
esh and cool, t
he pale hour ma
kes our faces l
ook grey. We tr
udge onward in 
single file thr
ough the trench
es and shell-ho
les and come ag
ain to the zone
 of mist. Katcz
insky is restiv
e, that's a bad
 sign. "What's 
up, Kat?" says 
Kropp. "I wish 
I were back hom
e." Home--he me
ans the huts. "
It won't last m
uch longer, Kat
." He is nervou
s. "I don't kno
w, I don't know
----" We come t
o the communica
tion-trench and
 then to the op
en fields. The 
little wood rea
ppears; we know
 every foot of 
ground here. Th
ere's the cemet
ery with the mo
unds and the bl
ack crosses. Th
at moment it br
eaks out behind
 us, swells, ro
ars, and thunde
rs. We duck dow
n--a cloud of f
lame shoots up 
a hundred yards
 ahead of us. T
he next minute 
under a second 
explosion part 
of the wood ris
es slowly in th
e air, three or
 four trees sai
l up and then c
rash to pieces.
 The shells beg
in to hiss like
 safety-valves-
-heavy fire----
 "Take cover!" 
yells somebody-
-"Cover!" The f
ields are flat,
 the wood is to
o distant and d
angerous--the o
nly cover is th
e graveyard and
 the mounds. We
 stumble across
 in the dark an
d as though spi
rited away ever
y man lies glue
d behind a moun
d. Not a moment
 too soon. The 
dark goes mad. 
It heaves and r
aves. Darknesse
s blacker than 
the night rush 
on us with gian
t strides, over
 us and away. T
he flames of th
e explosions li
ght up the grav
eyard. There is
 no escape anyw
here. By the li
ght of the shel
ls I try to get
 a view of the 
fields. They ar
e a surging sea
, daggers of fl
ame from the ex
plosions leap u
p like fountain
s. It is imposs
ible for anyone
 to break throu
gh it. The wood
 vanishes, it i
s pounded, crus
hed, torn to pi
eces. We must s
tay here in the
 grave-yard. Th
e earth bursts 
before us. It r
ains clods. I f
eel a smack. My
 sleeve is torn
 away by a spli
nter. I shut my
 fist. No pain.
 Still that doe
s not reassure 
me: wounds don'
t hurt till aft
erwards. I feel
 the arm all ov
er. It is graze
d but sound. No
w a crack on th
e skull, I begi
n to lose consc
iousness. Like 
lightning the t
hought comes to
 me: Don't fain
t, sink down in
 the black brot
h and immediate
ly come up to t
he top again. A
 splinter slash
es into my helm
et, but has tra
velled so far t
hat it does not
 go through. I 
wipe the mud ou
t of my eyes. A
 hole is torn u
p in front of m
e. Shells hardl
y ever land in 
the same hole t
wice, I'll get 
into it. With o
ne bound I flin
g myself down a
nd lie on the e
arth as flat as
 a fish; there 
it whistles aga
in, quickly I c
rouch together,
 claw for cover
, feel somethin
g on the left, 
shove in beside
 it, it gives w
ay, I groan, th
e earth leaps, 
the blast thund
ers in my ears,
 I creep under 
the yielding th
ing, cover myse
lf with it, dra
w it over me, i
t is wood, clot
h, cover, cover
, miserable cov
er against the 
whizzing splint
ers. I open my 
eyes--my finger
s grasp a sleev
e, an arm. A wo
unded man? I ye
ll to him--no a
nswer--a dead m
an. My hand gro
pes farther, sp
linters of wood
--now I remembe
r again that we
 are lying in t
he graveyard. B
ut the shelling
 is stronger th
an everything. 
It wipes out th
e sensibilities
, I merely craw
l still deeper 
into the coffin
, it should pro
tect me, and es
pecially as Dea
th himself lies
 in it too. Bef
ore me gapes th
e shell-hole. I
 grasp it with 
my eyes as with
 fists. With on
e leap I must b
e in it. There,
 I get a smack 
in the face, a 
hand clamps on 
to my shoulder-
-has the dead m
an waked up?--T
he hand shakes 
me, I turn my h
ead, in the sec
ond of light I 
stare into the 
face of Katczin
sky, he has his
 mouth wide ope
n and is yellin
g. I hear nothi
ng, he rattles 
me, comes neare
r, in a momenta
ry lull his voi
ce reaches me: 
"Gas--Gaas--Gaa
as--Pass it on.
" I grab for my
 gas-mask. Some
 distance from 
me there lies s
omeone. I think
 of nothing but
 this: That fel
low there must 
know: Gaaas--Ga
aas---- I call,
 I lean toward 
him, I swipe at
 him with the s
atchel, he does
n't see--once a
gain, again--he
 merely ducks--
it's a recruit-
-I look at Kat 
desperately, he
 has his mask r
eady--I pull ou
t mine too, my 
helmet falls to
 one side, it s
lips over my fa
ce, I reach the
 man, his satch
el is on the si
de nearest me, 
I seize the mas
k, pull it over
 his head, he u
nderstands, I l
et go and with 
a jump drop bac
k into the shel
l-hole. The dul
l thud of the g
as-shells mingl
es with the cra
shes of the hig
h explosives. A
 bell sounds be
tween the explo
sions, gongs, a
nd metal clappe
rs warning ever
yone--Gas--Gas-
-Gaas. Someone 
plumps down beh
ind me, another
. I wipe the go
ggles of my mas
k clear of the 
moist breath. I
t is Kat, Kropp
, and someone e
lse. All four o
f us lie there 
in heavy, watch
ful suspense an
d breathe as li
ghtly as possib
le. These first
 minutes with t
he mask decide 
between life an
d death: is it 
tightly woven? 
I remember the 
awful sights in
 the hospital: 
the gas patient
s who in day-lo
ng suffocation 
cough their bur
nt lungs up in 
clots. Cautious
ly, the mouth a
pplied to the v
alve, I breathe
. The gas still
 creeps over th
e ground and si
nks into all ho
llows. Like a b
ig, soft jellyf
ish it floats i
nto our shell-h
ole and lolls t
here obscenely.
 I nudge Kat, i
t is better to 
crawl out and l
ie on top than 
to stay here wh
ere the gas col
lects most. But
 we don't get a
s far as that; 
a second bombar
dment begins. I
t is no longer 
as though the s
hells roared; i
t is the earth 
itself raging. 
With a crash so
mething black b
ears down on us
. It lands clos
e beside us; a 
coffin thrown u
p. I see Kat mo
ve and I crawl 
across. The cof
fin has hit the
 fourth man in 
our hole on his
 outstretched a
rm. He tries to
 tear off his g
as-mask with th
e other hand. K
ropp seizes him
 just in time, 
twists the hand
 sharply behind
 his back and h
olds it fast. K
at and I procee
d to free the w
ounded arm. The
 coffin lid is 
loose and burst
s open, we are 
easily able to 
pull it off, we
 toss the corps
e out, it slide
s down to the b
ottom of the sh
ell-hole, then 
we try to loose
n the under-par
t. Fortunately 
the man swoons 
and Kropp is ab
le to help us. 
We no longer ha
ve to be carefu
l, but work awa
y till the coff
in gives with a
 sigh before th
e spade that we
 have dug in un
der it. It has 
grown lighter. 
Kat takes a pie
ce of the lid, 
places it under
 the shattered 
arm, and we wra
p all our banda
ges round it. F
or the moment w
e can do no mor
e. Inside the g
as-mask my head
 booms and roar
s--it is nigh b
ursting. My lun
gs are tight, t
hey breathe alw
ays the same ho
t, used-up air,
 the veins on m
y temples are s
wollen, I feel 
I am suffocatin
g. A grey light
 filters throug
h to us. I clim
b out over the 
edge of the she
ll-hole. In the
 dirty twilight
 lies a leg tor
n clean off; th
e boot is quite
 whole, I take 
that all in at 
a glance. Now s
omeone stands u
p a few yards d
istant. I polis
h the windows, 
in my excitemen
t they are imme
diately dimmed 
again, I peer t
hrough them, th
e man there no 
longer wears hi
s mask. I wait 
some seconds--h
e has not colla
psed--he looks 
around and make
s a few paces--
rattling in my 
throat I tear m
y mask off too 
and fall down, 
the air streams
 into me like c
old water, my e
yes are burstin
g, the wave swe
eps over me and
 extinguishes m
e. * * The shel
ling has ceased
. I drag myself
 to the crater 
and tell the ot
hers. They take
 off their mask
s. We lift up t
he wounded man,
 one taking his
 splintered arm
. And so we stu
mble off hastil
y. The graveyar
d is a mass of 
wreckage. Coffi
ns and corpses 
lie strewn abou
t. They have be
en killed once 
again; but each
 of them that w
as flung up sav
ed one of us. T
he hedge is des
troyed, the rai
ls of the light
 railway are to
rn up and rise 
stiffly in the 
air in great ar
ches. Someone l
ies in front of
 us. We stop; K
ropp goes on al
one with the wo
unded man. The 
man on the grou
nd is a recruit
. His hip is co
vered with bloo
d; he is so exh
austed that I f
eel for my wate
r-bottle where 
I have rum and 
tea. Kat restra
ins my hand and
 stoops over hi
m. "Where's it 
got you, comrad
e?" His eyes mo
ve. He is too w
eak to answer. 
We cut off his 
trousers carefu
lly. He groans.
 "Gently, gentl
y, it is much b
etter----" If h
e has been hit 
in the stomach 
he oughtn't to 
drink anything.
 There's no vom
iting, that's a
 good sign. We 
lay the hip bar
e. It is one ma
ss of mincemeat
 and bone splin
ters. The joint
 has been hit. 
This lad won't 
walk any more. 
I wet his templ
es with a moist
ened finger and
 give him a swi
g. His eyes mov
e again. We see
 now that the r
ight arm is ble
eding as well. 
Kat spreads out
 two wads of dr
essing as wide 
as possible so 
that they will 
cover the wound
. I look for so
mething to bind
 loosely round 
it. We have not
hing more, so I
 slit up the wo
unded man's tro
user leg still 
farther in orde
r to use a piec
e of his underp
ants as a banda
ge. But he is w
earing none. I 
now look at him
 closely. He is
 the fair-heade
d boy of a litt
le while ago. I
n the meantime 
Kat has taken a
 bandage from a
 dead man's poc
ket and we care
fully bind the 
wound. I say to
 the youngster 
who looks at us
 fixedly: "We'r
e going for a s
tretcher now---
-" Then he open
s his mouth and
 whispers: "Sta
y here----" "We
'll be back aga
in soon," says 
Kat. "We are on
ly going to get
 a stretcher fo
r you." We don'
t know if he un
derstands. He w
himpers like a 
child and pluck
s at us: "Don't
 go away----" K
at looks around
 and whispers: 
"Shouldn't we j
ust take a revo
lver and put an
 end to it?" Th
e youngster wil
l hardly surviv
e the carrying,
 and at the mos
t he will only 
last a few days
. What he has g
one through so 
far is nothing 
to what he's in
 for till he di
es. Now he is n
umb and feels n
othing. In an h
our he will bec
ome one screami
ng bundle of in
tolerable pain.
 Every day that
 he can live wi
ll be a howling
 torture. And t
o whom does it 
matter whether 
he has them or 
not---- I nod. 
"Yes, Kat, we o
ught to put him
 out of his mis
ery." He stands
 still a moment
. He has made u
p his mind. We 
look round--but
 we are no long
er alone. A lit
tle group is ga
thering, from t
he shell-holes 
and trenches ap
pear heads. We 
get a stretcher
. Kat shakes hi
s head. "Such a
 kid----" He re
peats it: "Youn
g innocents----
" * * Our losse
s are less than
 was to be expe
cted--five kill
ed and eight wo
unded. It was i
n fact quite a 
short bombardme
nt. Two of our 
dead lie in the
 upturned grave
s. We had merel
y to throw the 
earth in on the
m. We go back. 
We trot off sil
ently in single
 file one behin
d the other. Th
e wounded are t
aken to the dre
ssing-station. 
The morning is 
cloudy. The bea
rers make a fus
s about numbers
 and tickets, t
he wounded whim
per. It begins 
to rain. An hou
r later we reac
h our lorries a
nd climb in. Th
ere is more roo
m now than ther
e was. The rain
 becomes heavie
r. We take out 
waterproof shee
ts and spread t
hem over our he
ads. The rain r
attles down, an
d flows off at 
the sides in st
reams. The lorr
ies bump throug
h the holes, an
d we rock to an
d fro in a half
-sleep. Two men
 in the front o
f the lorry hav
e long forked p
oles. They watc
h for telephone
 wires which ha
ng crosswise ov
er the road so 
densely that th
ey might easily
 pull our heads
 off. The two f
ellows take the
m at the right 
moment on their
 poles and lift
 them over behi
nd us. We hear 
their call "Min
d--wire--," dip
 the knee in a 
half-sleep and 
straighten up a
gain. Monotonou
sly the lorries
 sway, monotono
usly come the c
alls, monotonou
sly falls the r
ain. It falls o
n our heads and
 on the heads o
f the dead up i
n the line, on 
the body of the
 little recruit
 with the wound
 that is so muc
h too big for h
is hip; it fall
s on Kemmerich'
s grave; it fal
ls in our heart
s. An explosion
 sounds somewhe
re. We wince, o
ur eyes become 
tense, our hand
s are ready to 
vault over the 
side of the lor
ry into the dit
ch by the road.
 It goes no far
ther--only the 
monotonous cry:
 "Mind--wire,"-
-our knees bend
--we are again 
half asleep. CH
APTER V Killing
 each separate 
louse is a tedi
ous business wh
en a man has hu
ndreds. The lit
tle beasts are 
hard and the ev
erlasting crack
ing with one's 
fingernails ver
y soon becomes 
wearisome. So T
jaden has rigge
d up the lid of
 a boot-polish 
tin with a piec
e of wire over 
the lighted stu
mp of a candle.
 The lice are s
imply thrown in
to this little 
pan. Crack! and
 they're done f
or. We sit arou
nd with our shi
rts on our knee
s, our bodies n
aked to the war
m air and our h
ands at work. H
aie has a parti
cularly fine br
and of louse: t
hey have a red 
cross on their 
heads. He sugge
sts that he bro
ught them back 
with him from t
he hospital at 
Thourhout, wher
e they attended
 personally on 
a surgeon-gener
al. He says he 
means to use th
e fat that slow
ly accumulates 
in the tin-lid 
for polishing h
is boots, and r
oars with laugh
ter for half an
 hour at his ow
n joke. But he 
hasn't much suc
cess to-day; we
 are too preocc
upied with anot
her affair. The
 rumour has mat
erialized. Himm
elstoss has com
e. He appeared 
yesterday; we'v
e already heard
 the well-known
 voice. He seem
s to have overd
one it with a c
ouple of young 
recruits on the
 ploughed field
 at home, and u
nknown to him t
he son of the l
ocal magistrate
 was watching. 
That cooked his
 goose. He will
 meet some surp
rises here. Tja
den has been me
ditating for ho
urs what to say
 to him. Haie g
azes thoughtful
ly at his great
 paws and winks
 at me. The thr
ashing was the 
high water mark
 of his life. H
e tells me he o
ften dreams of 
it. Kropp and M
üller are amusi
ng themselves. 
From somewhere 
or other, proba
bly the pioneer
-cook-house, Kr
opp has bagged 
for himself a m
ess-tin full of
 beans. Müller 
squints hungril
y into it but c
hecks himself a
nd says: "Alber
t, what would y
ou do if it wer
e suddenly peac
e-time again?" 
"There won't be
 any civil life
," says Albert 
bluntly. "Well,
 but if--" pers
ists Müller, "w
hat would you d
o?" "Clear out 
of this!" growl
s Kropp. "Of co
urse. And then 
what?" "Get dru
nk," says Alber
t. "Don't talk 
rot, I mean ser
iously----" "So
 do I," says Kr
opp, "what else
 should a man d
o?" Kat becomes
 interested. He
 levies tribute
 on Kropp's tin
 of beans, swal
lows some, then
 considers for 
a while and say
s: "You might g
et drunk first,
 of course, but
 then you'd tak
e the next trai
n for home and 
mother. Peace-t
ime, man, Alber
t----" He fumbl
es in his oil-c
loth pocket-boo
k for a photogr
aph and suddenl
y shows it all 
round. "My old 
people!" Then h
e puts it back 
and swears: "Da
mned lousy war-
---" "It's all 
very well for y
ou to talk," I 
tell him. "You'
ve a wife and c
hildren." "True
," he nods, "an
d I have to see
 to it that the
y've something 
to eat." We lau
gh. "They won't
 lack for that,
 Kat, you'd scr
ounge it from s
omewhere." Müll
er is insatiabl
e and gives him
self no peace. 
He wakes Haie W
esthus out of h
is dream. "Haie
, what would yo
u do if it was 
peace time?" "G
ive you a kick 
in the backside
 for the way yo
u talk," I say.
 "How does it c
ome about exact
ly?" "How does 
the cow-shit co
me on the roof?
" retorts Mülle
r laconically, 
and turns to Ha
ie Westhus agai
n. It is too mu
ch for Haie. He
 shakes his fre
ckled head: "Yo
u mean when the
 war's over?" "
Exactly. You've
 said it." "Wel
l, there'd be w
omen of course,
 eh?"--Haie lic
ks his lips. "S
ure." "By Jove 
yes," says Haie
, his face melt
ing, "then I'd 
grab some good 
buxom dame, som
e real kitchen 
wench with plen
ty to get hold 
of, you know, a
nd jump straigh
t into bed. Jus
t you think, bo
ys, a real feat
her-bed with a 
spring mattress
; I wouldn't pu
t trousers on a
gain for a week
." Everyone is 
silent. The pic
ture is too goo
d. Our flesh cr
eeps. At last M
üller pulls him
self together a
nd says: "And t
hen what?" A pa
use. Then Haie 
explains rather
 awkwardly: "If
 I were a non-c
om. I'd stay wi
th the Prussian
s and serve out
 my time." "Hai
e, you've got a
 screw loose, s
urely!" I say. 
"Have you ever 
dug peat?" he r
etorts good-nat
uredly. "You tr
y it." Then he 
pulls a spoon o
ut of the top o
f his boot and 
reaches over in
to Kropp's mess
-tin. "It can't
 be worse than 
digging trenche
s," I venture. 
Haie chews and 
grins: "It last
s longer though
. And there's n
o getting out o
f it either." "
But, man, surel
y it's better a
t home." "Some 
ways," says he,
 and with open 
mouth sinks int
o a day-dream. 
You can see wha
t he is thinkin
g. There is the
 mean little hu
t on the moors,
 the hard work 
on the heath fr
om morning till
 night in the h
eat, the misera
ble pay, the di
rty labourer's 
clothes. "In th
e army in peace
 time you've no
thing to troubl
e about," he go
es on, "your fo
od's found ever
y day, or else 
you kick up a r
ow; you've a be
d, every week c
lean under-wear
 like a perfect
 gent, you do y
our non-com.'s 
duty, you have 
a good suit of 
clothes; in the
 evening you're
 a free man and
 go off to the 
pub." Haie is e
xtraordinarily 
set on his idea
. He's in love 
with it. "And w
hen your twelve
 years are up y
ou get your pen
sion and become
 a village bobb
y, and you can 
walk about the 
whole day." He'
s already sweat
ing on it. "And
 just you think
 how you'd be t
reated. Here a 
dram, there a p
int. Everybody 
wants to be wel
l in with a bob
by." "You'll ne
ver be a non-co
m. though, Haie
," interrupts K
at. Haie looks 
at him sadly an
d is silent. Hi
s thoughts stil
l linger over t
he clear evenin
gs in autumn, t
he Sundays in t
he heather, the
 village bells,
 the afternoons
 and evenings w
ith the servant
 girls, the fri
ed bacon and ba
rley, the care-
free evening ho
urs in the ale-
house---- He ca
n't part with a
ll these dreams
 so abruptly; h
e merely growls
: "What silly q
uestions you do
 ask." He pulls
 his shirt over
 his head and b
uttons up his t
unic. "What wou
ld you do, Tjad
en?" asks Kropp
. Tjaden thinks
 only of one th
ing. "See to it
 that Himmelsto
ss doesn't get 
past me." Appar
ently he would 
like most to ha
ve him in a cag
e and sail into
 him with a clu
b every morning
. To Kropp he s
ays warmly: "If
 I were in your
 place I'd see 
to it that I be
came a lieutena
nt. Then you co
uld grind him t
ill the water i
n his backside 
boils." "And yo
u, Detering?" a
sks Müller like
 an inquisitor.
 He's a born sc
hoolmaster with
 all his questi
ons. Detering i
s sparing with 
his words. But 
on this subject
 he speaks. He 
looks at the sk
y and says only
 the one senten
ce: "I would go
 straight on wi
th the harvesti
ng." Then he ge
ts up and walks
 off. He is wor
ried. His wife 
has to look aft
er the farm. Th
ey've already t
aken away two o
f his horses. E
very day he rea
ds the papers t
hat come, to se
e whether it is
 raining in his
 little corner 
of Oldenburg. T
hey haven't bro
ught the hay in
 yet. At this m
oment Himmelsto
ss appears. He 
comes straight 
up to our group
. Tjaden's face
 turns red. He 
stretches his l
ength on the gr
ass and shuts h
is eyes in emba
rrassment. Himm
elstoss is a li
ttle hesitant, 
his gait become
s slower. Then 
he marches up t
o us. No one ma
kes any motion 
to stand up. Kr
opp looks up at
 him with inter
est. He continu
es to stand in 
front of us and
 wait. As no on
e says anything
 he launches a 
"Well?" A coupl
e of seconds go
 by. Apparently
 Himmelstoss do
esn't quite kno
w what to do. H
e would like mo
st to set us al
l on the run ag
ain. But he see
ms to have lear
ned already tha
t the front lin
e isn't a parad
e ground. He tr
ies it on thoug
h, and by addre
ssing himself t
o one instead o
f to all of us 
hopes to get so
me response. Kr
opp is nearest,
 so he favours 
him. "Well, you
 here too?" But
 Albert's no fr
iend of his. "A
 bit longer tha
n you, I fancy,
" he retorts. T
he red moustach
e twitches: "Yo
u don't recogni
ze me any more,
 what?" Tjaden 
now opens his e
yes. "I do thou
gh." Himmelstos
s turns to him:
 "Tjaden, isn't
 it?" Tjaden li
fts his head. "
And do you know
 what you are?"
 Himmelstoss is
 disconcerted. 
"Since when hav
e we become so 
familiar? I don
't remember tha
t we ever slept
 in the gutter 
together?" He h
as no idea what
 to make of the
 situation. He 
didn't expect t
his open hostil
ity. But he is 
on his guard: s
omeone has alre
ady dinned some
 rot into him a
bout getting a 
shot in the bac
k. The question
 about the gutt
er makes Tjaden
 so mad that he
 becomes almost
 witty: "No, yo
u slept there b
y yourself." Hi
mmelstoss begin
s to boil. But 
Tjaden gets in 
ahead of him. H
e must bring of
f his insult: "
Wouldn't you li
ke to know what
 you are? A dir
ty hound, that'
s what you are.
 I've been want
ing to tell you
 that for a lon
g time." The sa
tisfaction of m
onths shines in
 his dull pig's
 eyes as he spi
ts out: Dirty h
ound! Himmelsto
ss lets fly too
, now. "What's 
that, you muck-
rake, you dirty
 peat-stealer? 
Stand up there,
 bring your hee
ls together whe
n your superior
 officer speaks
 to you." Tjade
n winks solemnl
y. "You take a 
run and jump at
 yourself, Himm
elstoss." Himme
lstoss is a rag
ing book of arm
y regulations. 
The Kaiser coul
dn't be more in
sulted. "Tjaden
, I command you
, as your super
ior officer: St
and up!" "Anyth
ing else you wo
uld like?" asks
 Tjaden. "Will 
you obey my ord
er or not?" Tja
den replies, wi
thout knowing i
t, in the well-
known classical
 phrase. At the
 same time he v
entilates his b
ackside. "I'll 
have you court-
martialled," st
orms Himmelstos
s. We watch him
 disappear in t
he direction of
 the Orderly Ro
om. Haie and Tj
aden burst into
 a regular peat
-digger's bello
w. Haie laughs 
so much that he
 dislocates his
 jaw, and sudde
nly stands ther
e helpless with
 his mouth wide
 open. Albert h
as to put it ba
ck again by giv
ing it a blow w
ith his fist. K
at is troubled:
 "If he reports
 you, it'll be 
pretty serious.
" "Do you think
 he will?" asks
 Tjaden. "Sure 
to," I say. "Th
e least you'll 
get will be fiv
e days close ar
rest," says Kat
. That doesn't 
worry Tjaden. "
Five days clink
 are five days 
rest." "And if 
they send you t
o the Fortress?
" urges the tho
roughgoing Müll
er. "Well, for 
the time being 
the war will be
 over so far as
 I am concerned
." Tjaden is a 
cheerful soul. 
There aren't an
y worries for h
im. He goes off
 with Haie and 
Leer so that th
ey won't find h
im in the first
 flush of the e
xcitement. * * 
Müller hasn't f
inished yet. He
 tackles Kropp 
again. "Albert,
 if you were re
ally at home no
w, what would y
ou do?" Kropp i
s contented now
 and more accom
modating: "How 
many of us were
 there in the c
lass exactly?" 
We count up: ou
t of twenty, se
ven are dead, f
our wounded, on
e in a mad-hous
e. That makes t
welve privates.
 "Three of them
 are lieutenant
s," says Müller
. "Do you think
 they would sti
ll let Kantorek
 sit on them?" 
We guess not: w
e wouldn't let 
ourselves be sa
t on for that m
atter. "What do
 you mean by th
e three-fold th
eme in 'William
 Tell'?" says K
ropp reminiscen
tly, and roars 
with laughter. 
"What was the p
urpose of the P
oetic League of
 Göttingen?" as
ks Müller sudde
nly and earnest
ly. "How many c
hildren had Cha
rles the Bald?"
 I interrupt ge
ntly. "You'll n
ever make anyth
ing of your lif
e, Bäumer," cro
aks Müller. "Wh
en was the Batt
le of Zana?" Kr
opp wants to kn
ow. "You lack t
he studious min
d, Kropp, sit d
own, three minu
s----" I wink. 
"What offices d
id Lycurgus con
sider the most 
important for t
he state?" asks
 Müller, preten
ding to take of
f his pince-nez
. "Does it go: 
'We Germans fea
r God and none 
else in the who
le world,' or '
We, the Germans
, fear God and-
---'" I submit.
 "How many inha
bitants has Mel
bourne?" asks M
üller. "How do 
you expect to s
ucceed in life 
if you don't kn
ow that?" I ask
 Albert hotly. 
Which he caps w
ith: "What is m
eant by Cohesio
n?" We remember
 mighty little 
of all that rub
bish. Anyway, i
t has never bee
n the slightest
 use to us. At 
school nobody e
ver taught us h
ow to light a c
igarette in a s
torm of rain, n
or how a fire c
ould be made wi
th wet wood--no
r that it is be
st to stick a b
ayonet in the b
elly because th
ere it doesn't 
get jammed, as 
it does in the 
ribs. Müller sa
ys thoughtfully
: "What's the u
se. We'll have 
to go back and 
sit on the form
s again." I con
sider that out 
of the question
. "We might tak
e a special exa
m." "That needs
 preparation. A
nd if you do ge
t through, what
 then? A studen
t's life isn't 
any better. If 
you have no mon
ey, you have to
 work like the 
devil." "It's a
 bit better. Bu
t it's rot all 
the same, every
thing they teac
h you." Kropp s
upports me: "Ho
w can a man tak
e all that stuf
f seriously whe
n he's once bee
n out here?" "S
till you must h
ave an occupati
on of some sort
," insists Müll
er, as though h
e were Kantorek
 himself. Alber
t cleans his na
ils with a knif
e. We are surpr
ised at this de
licacy. But it 
is merely pensi
veness. He puts
 the knife away
 and continues:
 "That's just i
t. Kat and Dete
ring and Haie w
ill go back to 
their jobs beca
use they had th
em already. Him
melstoss too. B
ut we never had
 any. How will 
we ever get use
d to one after 
this, here?"--h
e makes a gestu
re toward the f
ront. "We'll wa
nt a private in
come, and then 
we'll be able t
o live by ourse
lves in a wood,
" I say, but at
 once feel asha
med of this abs
urd idea. "But 
what will reall
y happen when w
e go back?" won
ders Müller, an
d even he is tr
oubled. Kropp g
ives a shrug. "
I don't know. L
et's get back f
irst, then we'l
l find out." We
 are all utterl
y at a loss. "W
hat could we do
?" I ask. "I do
n't want to do 
anything," repl
ies Kropp weari
ly. "You'll be 
dead one day, s
o what does it 
matter? I don't
 think we'll ev
er go back." "W
hen I think abo
ut it, Albert,"
 I say after a 
while, rolling 
over on my back
, "when I hear 
the word 'peace
 time,' it goes
 to my head; an
d if it really 
came, I think I
 would do some 
unimaginable th
ing--something,
 you know, that
 it's worth hav
ing lain here i
n the muck for.
 But I can't ev
en imagine anyt
hing. All I do 
know is that th
is business abo
ut professions 
and studies and
 salaries and s
o on--it makes 
me sick, it is 
and always was 
disgusting. I d
on't see anythi
ng--I don't see
 anything at al
l, Albert." All
 at once everyt
hing seems to m
e confused and 
hopeless. Kropp
 feels it too. 
"It will go pre
tty hard with u
s all. But nobo
dy at home seem
s to worry much
 about it. Two 
years of shells
 and bombs--a m
an won't peel t
hat off as easy
 as a sock." We
 agree that it'
s the same for 
everyone; not o
nly for us here
, but everywher
e, for everyone
 who is of our 
age; to some mo
re, and to othe
rs less. It is 
the common fate
 of our generat
ion. Albert exp
resses it: "The
 war has ruined
 us for everyth
ing." He is rig
ht. We are not 
youth any longe
r. We don't wan
t to take the w
orld by storm. 
We are fleeing.
 We fly from ou
rselves. From o
ur life. We wer
e eighteen and 
had begun to lo
ve life and the
 world; and we 
had to shoot it
 to pieces. The
 first bomb, th
e first explosi
on, burst in ou
r hearts. We ar
e cut off from 
activity, from 
striving, from 
progress. We be
lieve in such t
hings no longer
, we believe in
 the war. * * T
he Orderly Room
 shows signs of
 life. Himmelst
oss seems to ha
ve stirred them
 up. At the hea
d of the column
 trots the fat 
sergeant-major.
 It is queer th
at almost all p
ay-sergeant-maj
ors are fat. Hi
mmelstoss follo
ws him, thirsti
ng for vengeanc
e. His boots gl
eam in the sun.
 We get up. "Wh
ere's Tjaden?" 
the sergeant pu
ffs. No one kno
ws, of course. 
Himmelstoss glo
wers at us wrat
hfully. "You kn
ow very well. Y
ou won't say, t
hat's the fact 
of the matter. 
Out with it!" F
atty looks roun
d enquiringly; 
but Tjaden is n
ot to be seen. 
He tries anothe
r way. "Tjaden 
will report at 
the Orderly Roo
m in ten minute
s." Then he ste
ams off with Hi
mmelstoss in hi
s wake. "I have
 a feeling that
 next time we g
o up wiring I'l
l be letting a 
bundle of wire 
fall on Himmels
toss's leg," hi
nts Kropp. "We'
ll have quite a
 lot of jokes w
ith him," laugh
s Müller.-- Tha
t is our sole a
mbition: to kno
ck the conceit 
out of a postma
n.-- I go into 
the hut and put
 Tjaden wise. H
e disappears. T
hen we change o
ur possy and li
e down again to
 play cards. We
 know how to do
 that: to play 
cards, to swear
, and to fight.
 Not much for t
wenty years;--a
nd yet too much
 for twenty yea
rs. Half an hou
r later Himmels
toss is back ag
ain. Nobody pay
s any attention
 to him. He ask
s for Tjaden. W
e shrug our sho
ulders. "Then y
ou'd better fin
d him," he pers
ists. "Haven't 
you been to loo
k for him?" Kro
pp lies back in
 the grass and 
says: "Have you
 ever been out 
here before?" "
That's none of 
your business,"
 retorts Himmel
stoss. "I expec
t an answer." "
Very good," say
s Kropp, gettin
g up. "See up t
here where thos
e little white 
clouds are. Tho
se are anti-air
craft. We were 
over there yest
erday. Five dea
d and eight wou
nded. It was a 
lot of fun. Nex
t time, when yo
u go up with us
, before they d
ie the fellows 
will come up to
 you, click the
ir heels, and a
sk stiffly: 'Pl
ease may I go? 
Please may I ho
p it? We've bee
n waiting here 
a long time for
 someone like y
ou.'" He sits d
own again and H
immelstoss disa
ppears like a c
omet. "Three da
ys C.B.," Kat c
onjectures. "Ne
xt time I'll le
t fly," I say t
o Albert. But t
hat is the end.
 The case comes
 up for trial i
n the evening. 
In the Orderly 
Room sits our L
ieutenant, Bert
ink, and calls 
us in one after
 another. I hav
e to appear as 
a witness and e
xplain the reas
on of Tjaden's 
insubordination
. The story of 
the bed-wetting
 makes an impre
ssion. Himmelst
oss is recalled
 and I repeat m
y statement. "I
s that right?" 
Bertink asks Hi
mmelstoss. He t
ries to evade t
he question, bu
t in the end ha
s to confess, f
or Kropp tells 
the same story.
 "Why didn't so
meone report th
e matter, then?
" asks Bertink.
 We are silent:
 he must know h
imself how much
 use it is repo
rting such thin
gs in the army.
 It isn't usual
 to make compla
ints in the arm
y. He understan
ds it all right
 though, and le
ctures Himmelst
oss, making it 
plain to him th
at the front is
n't a parade-gr
ound. Then come
s Tjaden's turn
, who gets a lo
ng sermon and t
hree days open 
arrest. He give
s Kropp a wink 
and one day's o
pen arrest. "It
 can't be helpe
d," he says to 
him regretfully
. He is a decen
t fellow. Open 
arrest is quite
 pleasant. The 
clink was once 
a fowl-house; t
here we can vis
it the prisoner
s, we know how 
to manage it. C
lose arrest wou
ld have meant t
he cellar. They
 used to tie us
 to a tree, but
 that is forbid
den now. In man
y ways we are t
reated quite li
ke men. An hour
 after Tjaden a
nd Kropp are se
ttled in behind
 their wire-net
ting we make ou
r way in to the
m. Tjaden greet
s us crowing. T
hen we play ska
t far into the 
night. Tjaden w
ins of course, 
the lucky wretc
h. * * When we 
break up Kat sa
ys to me: "What
 do you say to 
some roast goos
e?" "Not bad," 
I agree. We cli
mb up on a muni
tion-waggon. Th
e ride costs us
 two cigarettes
. Kat has marke
d the spot exac
tly. The shed b
elongs to a reg
imental headqua
rters. I agree 
to get the goos
e and receive m
y instructions.
 The out-house 
is behind the w
all and the doo
r shuts with ju
st a peg. Kat h
oists me up. I 
rest my foot in
 his hands and 
climb over the 
wall. Kat keeps
 watch below. I
 wait a few mom
ents to accusto
m my eyes to th
e darkness. The
n I recognize t
he shed. Softly
 I steal across
, lift the peg,
 pull it out an
d open the door
. I distinguish
 two white patc
hes. Two geese,
 that's bad: if
 I grab one the
 other will cac
kle. Well, both
 of them--if I'
m quick, it can
 be done. I mak
e a jump. I cat
ch hold of one 
and the next in
stant the secon
d. Like a madma
n I bash their 
heads against t
he wall to stun
 them. But I ha
ven't quite eno
ugh weight. The
 beasts cackle 
and strike out 
with their feet
 and wings. I f
ight desperatel
y, but Lord! wh
at a kick a goo
se has! They st
ruggle and I st
agger about. In
 the dark these
 white patches 
are terrifying.
 My arms have g
rown wings and 
I'm almost afra
id of going up 
into the sky, a
s though I held
 a couple of ca
ptive balloons 
in my fists. Th
en the row begi
ns; one of them
 gets his breat
h and goes off 
like an alarm c
lock. Before I 
can do anything
, something com
es in from outs
ide; I feel a b
low, lie outstr
etched on the f
loor, and hear 
awful growls. A
 dog. I steal a
 glance to the 
side, he makes 
a snap at my th
roat. I lie sti
ll and tuck my 
chin into my co
llar. It's a bu
ll dog. After a
n eternity he w
ithdraws his he
ad and sits dow
n beside me. Bu
t if I make the
 least movement
 he growls. I c
onsider. The on
ly thing to do 
is to get hold 
of my small rev
olver, and that
 too before any
one arrives. In
ch by inch I mo
ve my hand towa
rd it. I have t
he feeling that
 it lasts an ho
ur. The slighte
st movement and
 then an awful 
growl; I lie st
ill, then try a
gain. When at l
ast I have the 
revolver my han
d starts to tre
mble. I press i
t against the g
round and then 
say over to mys
elf: Jerk the r
evolver up, fir
e before he has
 a chance to gr
ab, and then ju
mp up. Slowly I
 take a deep br
eath and become
 calmer. Then I
 hold my breath
, whip up the r
evolver, it cra
cks, the dog le
aps howling to 
one side, I mak
e for the door 
of the shed and
 fall head over
 heels over one
 of the damned 
geese. At full 
speed I seize i
t again, and wi
th a swing toss
 it over the wa
ll and clamber 
up. No sooner a
m I on top than
 the dog is up 
again as lively
 as ever and sp
rings at me. Qu
ickly I let mys
elf drop. Ten p
aces away stand
s Kat with the 
goose under his
 arm. As soon a
s he sees me we
 run. At last w
e can take a br
eather. The goo
se is dead, Kat
 saw to that in
 a moment. We i
ntend to roast 
it, without tel
ling anybody. I
 fetch a stove 
and wood from t
he hut and we c
rawl into a sma
ll deserted lea
n-to which we u
se for such pur
poses. The sing
le window space
 is heavily cur
tained. There i
s a sort of hea
rth, an iron pl
ate set on some
 bricks. We kin
dle a fire. Kat
 plucks and cle
ans the goose. 
We put the feat
hers carefully 
to one side. We
 intend to make
 two cushions o
ut of them with
 the inscriptio
n: "Sleep soft 
under shell fir
e." The sound o
f the gun-fire 
from the front 
penetrates into
 our refuge. Th
e glow of the f
ire lights up o
ur faces, shado
ws dance on the
 wall. Sometime
s a heavy crash
 and the hut sh
ivers. Aeroplan
e bombs. Once w
e hear a stifle
d cry. A hut mu
st have been hi
t. Aeroplanes d
rone; the tack-
tack of machine
 guns breaks ou
t. But no light
 that could be 
observed shows 
from us. We sit
 opposite one a
nother, Kat and
 I, two soldier
s in shabby coa
ts, cooking a g
oose in the mid
dle of the nigh
t. We don't tal
k much, but I b
elieve we have 
a more complete
 communion with
 one another th
an even lovers 
have. We are tw
o men, two minu
te sparks of li
fe; outside is 
the night and t
he circle of de
ath. We sit on 
the edge of it 
crouching in da
nger, the greas
e drips from ou
r hands, in our
 hearts we are 
close to one an
other, and the 
hour is like th
e room: flecked
 over with the 
lights and shad
ows of our feel
ings cast by a 
quiet fire. Wha
t does he know 
of me or I of h
im? formerly we
 should not hav
e had a single 
thought in comm
on--now we sit 
with a goose be
tween us and fe
el in unison, a
nd are so intim
ate that we do 
not even speak.
 It takes a lon
g time to roast
 a goose, even 
when it is youn
g and fat. So w
e take turns. O
ne bastes it wh
ile the other l
ies down and sl
eeps. A grand s
mell gradually 
fills the hut. 
The noises with
out increase in
 volume, pass i
nto my dream an
d yet linger in
 my memory. In 
a half sleep I 
watch Kat dip a
nd raise the la
dle. I love him
, his shoulders
, his angular, 
stooping figure
--and at the sa
me time I see b
ehind him woods
 and stars, and
 a clear voice 
utters words th
at bring me pea
ce, to me, a so
ldier in big bo
ots, belt, and 
knapsack, takin
g the road that
 lies before hi
m under the hig
h heaven, quick
ly forgetting a
nd seldom sorro
wful, for ever 
pressing on und
er the wide nig
ht sky. A littl
e soldier and a
 clear voice, a
nd if anyone we
re to caress hi
m he would hard
ly understand, 
this soldier wi
th the big boot
s and shut hear
t, who marches 
because he is w
earing big boot
s, and has forg
otten all else 
but marching. B
eyond the sky-l
ine is a countr
y with flowers,
 lying so still
 that he would 
like to weep. T
here are sights
 there that he 
has not forgott
en, because he 
never possessed
 them--perplexi
ng, yet lost to
 him. Are not h
is twenty summe
rs there? Is my
 face wet, and 
where am I? Kat
 stands before 
me, his giganti
c, stooping sha
dow falls upon 
me like home. H
e speaks gently
, he smiles and
 goes back to t
he fire. Then h
e says: "It's d
one." "Yes, Kat
." I stir mysel
f. In the middl
e of the room s
hines the brown
 goose. We take
 out our collap
sible forks and
 our pocket-kni
ves and each cu
ts off a leg. W
ith it we have 
army bread dipp
ed in gravy. We
 eat slowly and
 with gusto. "H
ow does it tast
e, Kat?" "Good!
 And yours?" "G
ood, Kat." We a
re brothers and
 press on one a
nother the choi
cest pieces. Af
terwards I smok
e a cigarette a
nd Kat a cigar.
 There is still
 a lot left. "H
ow would it be,
 Kat, if we too
k a bit to Krop
p and Tjaden?" 
"Sure," says he
. We carve off 
a portion and w
rap it up caref
ully in newspap
er. The rest we
 thought of tak
ing over to the
 hut. Kat laugh
s, and simply s
ays: "Tjaden." 
I agree, we wil
l have to take 
it all. So we g
o off to the fo
wl-house to wak
e them. But fir
st we pack away
 the feathers. 
Kropp and Tjade
n take us for m
agicians. Then 
they get busy w
ith their teeth
. Tjaden holds 
a wing in his m
outh with both 
hands like a mo
uth-organ, and 
gnaws. He drink
s the gravy fro
m the pot and s
macks his lips:
 "May I never f
orget you!" We 
go to our hut. 
Again there is 
the lofty sky w
ith the stars a
nd the oncoming
 dawn, and I pa
ss on beneath i
t, a soldier wi
th big boots an
d a full belly,
 a little soldi
er in the early
 morning--but b
y my side, stoo
ping and angula
r, goes Kat, my
 comrade. The o
utlines of the 
huts are upon u
s in the dawn l
ike a dark, dee
p sleep. CHAPTE
R VI There are 
rumours of an o
ffensive. We go
 up to the fron
t two days earl
ier than usual.
 On the way we 
pass a shelled 
school-house. S
tacked up again
st its longer s
ide is a high d
ouble wall of y
ellow, unpolish
ed, brand-new c
offins. They st
ill smell of fi
r, and pine, an
d the forest. T
here are at lea
st a hundred. "
That's a good p
reparation for 
the offensive,"
 says Müller as
tonished. "They
're for us," gr
owls Detering. 
"Don't talk rot
," says Kat to 
him angrily. "Y
ou be thankful 
if you get so m
uch as a coffin
," grins Tjaden
, "they'll slip
 you a water-pr
oof sheet for y
our old Aunt Sa
lly of a carcas
e." The others 
jest too, unple
asant jests, bu
t what else can
 a man do?--The
 coffins are re
ally for us. Th
e organization 
surpasses itsel
f in that kind 
of thing. Ahead
 of us everythi
ng is simmering
. The first nig
ht we try to ge
t our bearings.
 When it is fai
rly quiet we ca
n hear the tran
sports behind t
he enemy lines 
rolling ceasele
ssly until dawn
. Kat says they
 do not go back
 but are bringi
ng up troops--t
roops, munition
s, and shells. 
The English art
illery has been
 strengthened, 
that we can det
ect at once. Th
ere are at leas
t four more bat
teries of twent
y-fives to the 
right of the fa
rm, and behind 
the poplars the
y have put in t
rench-mortars. 
Besides these t
hey have brough
t up a number o
f those little 
French beasts w
ith instantaneo
us fuses. We ar
e in low spirit
s. After we hav
e been in the d
ug-outs two hou
rs our own shel
ls begin to fal
l in the trench
. This is the t
hird time in fo
ur weeks. If it
 were simply a 
mistake in aim 
no one would sa
y anything, but
 the truth is t
hat the barrels
 are worn out. 
The shots are o
ften so uncerta
in that they la
nd within our o
wn lines. To-ni
ght two of our 
men were wounde
d by them. * * 
The front is a 
cage in which w
e must await fe
arfully whateve
r may happen. W
e lie under the
 network of arc
hing shells and
 live in a susp
ense of uncerta
inty. Over us C
hance hovers. I
f a shot comes,
 we can duck, t
hat is all; we 
neither know no
r can determine
 where it will 
fall. It is thi
s Chance that m
akes us indiffe
rent. A few mon
ths ago I was s
itting in a dug
-out playing sk
at; after a whi
le I stood up a
nd went to visi
t some friends 
in another dug-
out. On my retu
rn nothing more
 was to be seen
 of the first o
ne, it had been
 blown to piece
s by a direct h
it. I went back
 to the second 
and arrived jus
t in time to le
nd a hand diggi
ng it out. In t
he interval it 
had been buried
. It is just as
 much a matter 
of chance that 
I am still aliv
e as that I mig
ht have been hi
t. In a bomb-pr
oof dug-out I m
ay be smashed t
o atoms and in 
the open may su
rvive ten hours
' bombardment u
nscathed. No so
ldier outlives 
a thousand chan
ces. But every 
soldier believe
s in Chance and
 trusts his luc
k. * * We must 
look out for ou
r bread. The ra
ts have become 
much more numer
ous lately beca
use the trenche
s are no longer
 in good condit
ion. Detering s
ays it is a sur
e sign of a com
ing bombardment
. The rats here
 are particular
ly repulsive, t
hey are so fat-
-the kind we ca
ll corpse-rats.
 They have shoc
king, evil, nak
ed faces, and i
t is nauseating
 to see their l
ong, nude tails
. They seem to 
be mighty hungr
y. Almost every
 man has had hi
s bread gnawed.
 Kropp wrapped 
his in his wate
rproof sheet an
d put it under 
his head, but h
e cannot sleep 
because they ru
n over his face
 to get at it. 
Detering meant 
to outwit them:
 he fastened a 
thin wire to th
e roof and susp
ended his bread
 from it. Durin
g the night whe
n he switched o
n his pocket-to
rch he saw the 
wire swinging t
o and fro. On t
he bread was ri
ding a fat rat.
 At last we put
 a stop to it. 
We cannot affor
d to throw the 
bread away, bec
ause already we
 have practical
ly nothing left
 to eat in the 
morning, so we 
carefully cut o
ff the bits of 
bread that the 
animals have gn
awed. The slice
s we cut off ar
e heaped togeth
er in the middl
e of the floor.
 Each man takes
 out his spade 
and lies down p
repared to stri
ke. Detering, K
ropp, and Kat h
old their pocke
t-lamps ready. 
After a few min
utes we hear th
e first shuffli
ng and tugging.
 It grows, now 
it is the sound
 of many little
 feet. Then the
 torches switch
 on and every m
an strikes at t
he heap, which 
scatters with a
 rush. The resu
lt is good. We 
toss the bits o
f rat over the 
parapet and aga
in lie in wait.
 Several times 
we repeat the p
rocess. At last
 the beasts get
 wise to it, or
 perhaps they h
ave scented the
 blood. They re
turn no more. N
evertheless, be
fore morning th
e remainder of 
the bread on th
e floor has bee
n carried off. 
In the adjoinin
g sector they a
ttacked two lar
ge cats and a d
og, bit them to
 death and devo
ured them. Next
 day there is a
n issue of Edam
er cheese. Each
 man gets almos
t a quarter of 
a cheese. In on
e way that is a
ll to the good,
 for Edamer is 
tasty--but in a
nother way it i
s vile, because
 the fat red ba
lls have long b
een a sign of a
 bad time comin
g. Our forebodi
ngs increase as
 rum is served 
out. We drink i
t of course; bu
t are not great
ly comforted. F
or days we loaf
 about and make
 war on the rat
s. Ammunition a
nd hand-grenade
s become more p
lentiful. We ev
en overhaul the
 bayonets--that
 is to say, the
 ones that have
 a saw on the b
lunt edge. If t
he fellows over
 there catch a 
man with one of
 those he's kil
led at sight. I
n the next sect
or some of our 
men were found 
whose noses wer
e cut off and t
heir eyes poked
 out with their
 own saw-bayone
ts. Their mouth
s and noses wer
e stuffed with 
sawdust so that
 they suffocate
d. Some of the 
recruits have b
ayonets of this
 kind; we take 
them away and g
ive them the or
dinary kind. Bu
t the bayonet h
as practically 
lost its import
ance. It is usu
ally the fashio
n now to charge
 with bombs and
 spades only. T
he sharpened sp
ade is a more h
andy and many-s
ided weapon; no
t only can it b
e used for jabb
ing a man under
 the chin, but 
it is much bett
er for striking
 with because o
f its greater w
eight, and if o
ne hits between
 the neck and s
houlder it easi
ly cleaves as f
ar down as the 
chest. The bayo
net frequently 
jams on the thr
ust and then a 
man has to kick
 hard on the ot
her fellow's be
lly to pull it 
out again; and 
in the interval
 he may easily 
get one himself
. And what's mo
re the blade of
ten gets broken
 off. At night 
they send over 
gas. We expect 
the attack to f
ollow and lie w
ith our masks o
n, ready to tea
r them off as s
oon as the firs
t shadow appear
s. Dawn approac
hes without any
thing happening
--only the ever
lasting, nerve-
wracking roll b
ehind the enemy
 lines, trains,
 trains, lorrie
s, lorries; but
 what are they 
concentrating? 
Our artillery f
ires on it cont
inually, but st
ill it does not
 cease. We have
 tired faces an
d avoid each ot
her's eyes. "It
 will be like t
he Somme," says
 Kat gloomily. 
"There we were 
shelled steadil
y for seven day
s and nights." 
Kat has lost al
l his fun since
 we have been h
ere, which is b
ad, for Kat is 
an old front-ho
g, and can smel
l what is comin
g. Only Tjaden 
seems pleased w
ith the good ra
tions and the r
um; he thinks w
e might even go
 back to rest w
ithout anything
 happening at a
ll. It almost l
ooks like it. D
ay after day pa
sses. At night 
I squat in the 
listening-post.
 Above me the r
ockets and para
chute-lights sh
oot up and floa
t down again. I
 am cautious an
d tense, my hea
rt thumps. My e
yes turn again 
and again to th
e luminous dial
 of my watch; t
he hands will n
ot budge. Sleep
 hangs on my ey
elids, I work m
y toes in my bo
ots in order to
 keep awake. No
thing happens t
ill I am reliev
ed;--only the e
verlasting roll
ing over there.
 Gradually we g
row calmer and 
play skat and p
oker continuall
y. Perhaps we w
ill be lucky. A
ll day the sky 
is hung with ob
servation ballo
ons. There is a
 rumour that th
e enemy are goi
ng to put tanks
 over and use l
ow-flying plane
s for the attac
k. But that int
erests us less 
than what we he
ar of the new f
lame-throwers. 
* * We wake up 
in the middle o
f the night. Th
e earth booms. 
Heavy fire is f
alling on us. W
e crouch into c
orners. We dist
inguish shells 
of every calibr
e. Each man lay
s hold of his t
hings and looks
 again every mi
nute to reassur
e himself that 
they are still 
there. The dug-
out heaves, the
 night roars an
d flashes. We l
ook at each oth
er in the momen
tary flashes of
 light, and wit
h pale faces an
d pressed lips 
shake our heads
. Every man is 
aware of the he
avy shells tear
ing down the pa
rapet, rooting 
up the embankme
nt and demolish
ing the upper l
ayers of concre
te. When a shel
l lands in the 
trench we note 
how the hollow,
 furious blast 
is like a blow 
from the paw of
 a raging beast
 of prey. Alrea
dy by morning a
 few of the rec
ruits are green
 and vomiting. 
They are too in
experienced. Sl
owly the grey l
ight trickles i
nto the post an
d pales the fla
shes of the she
lls. Morning is
 come. The expl
osion of mines 
mingles with th
e gun-fire. Tha
t is the most d
ementing convul
sion of all. Th
e whole region 
where they go u
p becomes one g
rave. The relie
fs go out, the 
observers stagg
er in, covered 
with dirt, and 
trembling. One 
lies down in si
lence in the co
rner and eats, 
the other, a re
servist-reinfor
cement, sobs; t
wice he has bee
n flung over th
e parapet by th
e blast of the 
explosions with
out getting any
 more than shel
l-shock. The re
cruits are eyei
ng him. We must
 watch them, th
ese things are 
catching, alrea
dy some lips be
gin to quiver. 
It is good that
 it is growing 
daylight; perha
ps the attack w
ill come before
 noon. The bomb
ardment does no
t diminish. It 
is falling in t
he rear too. As
 far as one can
 see it spouts 
fountains of mu
d and iron. A w
ide belt is bei
ng raked. The a
ttack does not 
come, but the b
ombardment cont
inues. Slowly w
e become mute. 
Hardly a man sp
eaks. We cannot
 make ourselves
 understood. Ou
r trench is alm
ost gone. At ma
ny places it is
 only eighteen 
inches high, it
 is broken by h
oles, and crate
rs, and mountai
ns of earth. A 
shell lands squ
are in front of
 our post. At o
nce it is dark.
 We are buried 
and must dig ou
rselves out. Af
ter an hour the
 entrance is cl
ear again, and 
we are calmer b
ecause we have 
had something t
o do. Our compa
ny commander sc
rambles in and 
reports that tw
o dug-outs are 
gone. The recru
its calm themse
lves when they 
see him. He say
s that an attem
pt will be made
 to bring up fo
od this evening
. That sounds r
eassuring. No o
ne had thought 
of it except Tj
aden. Now the o
utside world se
ems to draw a l
ittle nearer: i
f food can be b
rought up, thin
k the recruits,
 then it can't 
really be so ba
d. We do not di
sabuse them; we
 know that food
 is as importan
t as ammunition
 and only for t
hat reason must
 be brought up.
 But it miscarr
ies. A second p
arty goes out, 
and it also tur
ns back. Finall
y Kat tries, an
d even he reapp
ears without ac
complishing any
thing. No one g
ets through, no
t even a fly is
 small enough t
o get through s
uch a barrage. 
We pull in our 
belts tighter a
nd chew every m
outhful three t
imes as long. S
till the food d
oes not last ou
t; we are damna
bly hungry. I t
ake out a scrap
 of bread, eat 
the white and p
ut the crust ba
ck in my knapsa
ck; from time t
o time I nibble
 at it. * * The
 night is unbea
rable. We canno
t sleep, but st
are ahead of us
 and doze. Tjad
en regrets that
 we wasted the 
gnawed pieces o
f bread on the 
rats. We would 
gladly have the
m again to eat 
now. We are sho
rt of water, to
o, but not seri
ously yet. Towa
rds morning, wh
ile it is still
 dark, there is
 some excitemen
t. Through the 
entrance rushes
 in a swarm of 
fleeing rats th
at try to storm
 the walls. Tor
ches light up t
he confusion. E
veryone yells a
nd curses and s
laughters. The 
madness and des
pair of many ho
urs unloads its
elf in this out
burst. Faces ar
e distorted, ar
ms strike out, 
the beasts scre
am; we just sto
p in time to av
oid attacking o
ne another. The
 onslaught has 
exhausted us. W
e lie down to w
ait again. It i
s a marvel that
 our post has h
ad no casualtie
s so far. It is
 one of the few
 deep dug-outs.
 A corporal cre
eps in; he has 
a loaf of bread
 with him. Thre
e people have h
ad the luck to 
get through dur
ing the night a
nd bring some p
rovisions. They
 say the bombar
dment extends u
ndiminished as 
far as the arti
llery lines. It
 is a mystery w
here the enemy 
gets all his sh
ells. We wait a
nd wait. By mid
day what I expe
cted happens. O
ne of the recru
its has a fit. 
I have been wat
ching him for a
 long time, gri
nding his teeth
 and opening an
d shutting his 
fists. These hu
nted, protrudin
g eyes, we know
 them too well.
 During the las
t few hours he 
has had merely 
the appearance 
of calm. He had
 collapsed like
 a rotten tree.
 Now he stands 
up, stealthily 
creeps across t
he floor, hesit
ates a moment a
nd then glides 
towards the doo
r. I intercept 
him and say: "W
here are you go
ing?" "I'll be 
back in a minut
e," says he, an
d tries to push
 past me. "Wait
 a bit, the she
lling will stop
 soon." He list
ens and for a m
oment his eye b
ecomes clear. T
hen again he ha
s the glowering
 eyes of a mad 
dog, he is sile
nt, he shoves m
e aside. "One m
inute, lad," I 
say. Kat notice
s. Just as the 
recruit shakes 
me off Kat jump
s in and we hol
d him. Then he 
begins to rave:
 "Leave me alon
e, let me go ou
t, I will go ou
t!" He won't li
sten to anythin
g and hits out,
 his mouth is w
et and pours ou
t words, half c
hoked, meaningl
ess words. It i
s a case of cla
ustrophobia, he
 feels as thoug
h he is suffoca
ting here and w
ants to get out
 at any price. 
If we let him g
o he would run 
about everywher
e regardless of
 cover. He is n
ot the first. T
hough he raves 
and his eyes ro
ll, it can't be
 helped, we hav
e to give him a
 hiding to brin
g him to his se
nses. We do it 
quickly and mer
cilessly, and a
t last he sits 
down quietly. T
he others have 
turned pale; le
t's hope it det
ers them. This 
bombardment is 
too much for th
e poor devils, 
they have been 
sent straight f
rom a recruitin
g-depot into a 
barrage that is
 enough to turn
 an old soldier
's hair grey. A
fter this affai
r the sticky, c
lose atmosphere
 works more tha
n ever on our n
erves. We sit a
s if in our gra
ves waiting onl
y to be closed 
in. Suddenly it
 howls and flas
hes terrificall
y, the dug-out 
cracks in all i
ts joints under
 a direct hit, 
fortunately onl
y a light one t
hat the concret
e blocks are ab
le to withstand
. It rings meta
llically, the w
alls reel, rifl
es, helmets, ea
rth, mud, and d
ust fly everywh
ere. Sulphur fu
mes pour in. If
 we were in one
 of those light
 dug-outs that 
they have been 
building lately
 instead of thi
s deep one, not
 one of us woul
d now be alive.
 But the effect
 is bad enough 
even so. The re
cruit starts to
 rave again and
 two others fol
low suit. One j
umps up and rus
hes out, we hav
e trouble with 
the other two. 
I start after t
he one who esca
pes and wonder 
whether to shoo
t him in the le
g--then it shri
eks again, I fl
ing myself down
 and when I sta
nd up the wall 
of the trench i
s plastered wit
h smoking splin
ters, lumps of 
flesh, and bits
 of uniform. I 
scramble back. 
The first recru
it seems actual
ly to have gone
 insane. He but
ts his head aga
inst the wall l
ike a goat. We 
must try to-nig
ht to take him 
to the rear. Me
anwhile we bind
 him, but in su
ch a way that i
n case of attac
k he can be rel
eased at once. 
Kat suggests a 
game of skat: i
t is easier whe
n a man has som
ething to do. B
ut it is no use
, we listen for
 every explosio
n that comes cl
ose, miscount t
he tricks, and 
fail to follow 
suit. We have t
o give it up. W
e sit as though
 in a hissing b
oiler that is b
eing belaboured
 from without o
n all sides. Ni
ght again. We a
re deadened by 
the strain--a d
eadly tension t
hat scrapes alo
ng one's spine 
like a gapped k
nife. Our legs 
refuse to move,
 our hands trem
ble, our bodies
 are a thin ski
n stretched pai
nfully over rep
ressed madness,
 over an almost
 irresistible, 
bursting roar. 
We have neither
 flesh nor musc
les any longer,
 we dare not lo
ok at one anoth
er for fear of 
some incalculab
le thing. So we
 shut our teeth
--it will end--
it will end--pe
rhaps we will c
ome through. Su
ddenly the near
er explosions c
ease. The shell
ing continues b
ut it has lifte
d and falls beh
ind us, our tre
nch is free. We
 seize the hand
-grenades, pitc
h them out in f
ront of the dug
-out and jump a
fter them. The 
bombardment has
 stopped and a 
heavy barrage n
ow falls behind
 us. The attack
 has come. No o
ne would believ
e that in this 
howling waste t
here could stil
l be men; but s
teel helmets no
w appear on all
 sides out of t
he trench, and 
fifty yards fro
m us a machine-
gun is already 
in position and
 barking. The w
ire-entanglemen
ts are torn to 
pieces. Yet the
y offer some ob
stacle. We see 
the storm-troop
s coming. Our a
rtillery opens 
fire. Machine-g
uns rattle, rif
les crack. The 
charge works it
s way across. H
aie and Kropp b
egin with the h
and-grenades. T
hey throw as fa
st as they can,
 others pass th
em, the handles
 with the strin
gs already pull
ed. Haie throws
 seventy-five y
ards, Kropp six
ty, it has been
 measured, the 
distance is imp
ortant. The ene
my as they run 
cannot do much 
before they are
 within forty y
ards. We recogn
ize the distort
ed faces, the s
mooth helmets: 
they are French
. They have alr
eady suffered h
eavily when the
y reach the rem
nants of the ba
rbed wire entan
glements. A who
le line has gon
e down before o
ur machine-guns
; then we have 
a lot of stoppa
ges and they co
me nearer. I se
e one of them, 
his face upturn
ed, fall into a
 wire cradle. H
is body collaps
es, his hands r
emain suspended
 as though he w
ere praying. Th
en his body dro
ps clean away a
nd only his han
ds with the stu
mps of his arms
, shot off, now
 hang in the wi
re. The moment 
we are about to
 retreat three 
faces rise up f
rom the ground 
in front of us.
 Under one of t
he helmets a da
rk pointed bear
d and two eyes 
that are fasten
ed on me. I rai
se my hand, but
 I cannot throw
 into those str
ange eyes; for 
one mad moment 
the whole slaug
hter whirls lik
e a circus roun
d me, and these
 two eyes that 
are alone motio
nless; then the
 head rises up,
 a hand, a move
ment, and my ha
nd-grenade flie
s through the a
ir and into him
. We make for t
he rear, pull w
ire cradles int
o the trench an
d leave bombs b
ehind us with t
he string pulle
d, which ensure
 us a fiery ret
reat. The machi
ne-guns are alr
eady firing fro
m the next posi
tion. We have b
ecome wild beas
ts. We do not f
ight, we defend
 ourselves agai
nst annihilatio
n. It is not ag
ainst men that 
we fling our bo
mbs, what do we
 know of men in
 this moment wh
en Death with h
ands and helmet
s is hunting us
 down--now, for
 the first time
 in three days 
we can see his 
face, now, for 
the first time 
in three days w
e can oppose hi
m; we feel a ma
d anger. No lon
ger do we lie h
elpless, waitin
g on the scaffo
ld, we can dest
roy and kill, t
o save ourselve
s, to save ours
elves and be re
venged. We crou
ch behind every
 corner, behind
 every barrier 
of barbed wire,
 and hurl heaps
 of explosives 
at the feet of 
the advancing e
nemy before we 
run. The blast 
of the hand-gre
nades impinges 
powerfully on o
ur arms and leg
s; crouching li
ke cats we run 
on, overwhelmed
 by this wave t
hat bears us al
ong, that fills
 us with feroci
ty, turning us 
into thugs, int
o murderers, in
to God only kno
ws what devils;
 this wave that
 multiplies our
 strength with 
fear and madnes
s and greed of 
life, seeking a
nd fighting for
 nothing but ou
r deliverance. 
If your own fat
her came over w
ith them you wo
uld not hesitat
e to fling a bo
mb into him. Th
e forward trenc
hes have been a
bandoned. Are t
hey still trenc
hes? They are b
lown to pieces,
 annihilated--t
here are only b
roken bits of t
renches, holes 
linked by track
s; nests of cra
ters, that is a
ll. But the ene
my's casualties
 increase. They
 did not count 
on so much resi
stance. * * It 
is nearly noon.
 The sun blazes
 hotly, the swe
at stings in ou
r eyes, we wipe
 it off on our 
sleeves and oft
en blood with i
t. At last we r
each a trench t
hat is in a som
ewhat better co
ndition. It is 
manned and read
y for the count
er-attack, it r
eceives us. Our
 guns open up i
n full blast an
d cut off the e
nemy attack. Th
e lines behind 
us stop. They c
an advance no f
arther. The att
ack is crushed 
by our artiller
y. We watch. Th
e fire lifts a 
hundred yards a
nd we break for
ward. Beside me
 a lance-corpor
al has his head
 torn off. He r
uns a few steps
 more while the
 blood spouts f
rom his neck li
ke a fountain. 
It does not com
e quite to hand
-to-hand fighti
ng; they are dr
iven back. We a
rrive once agai
n at our shatte
red trench and 
pass on beyond 
it. Oh, this tu
rning back agai
n! We reach the
 shelter of the
 reserves and y
earn to creep i
n and disappear
;--but instead 
we must turn ro
und and plunge 
again into the 
horror. If we w
ere not automat
a at that momen
t we would cont
inue lying ther
e, exhausted, a
nd without will
. But we are sw
ept forward aga
in, powerless, 
madly savage an
d raging; we wi
ll kill, for th
ey are still ou
r mortal enemie
s, their rifles
 and bombs are 
aimed against u
s, and if we do
n't destroy the
m, they will de
stroy us. The b
rown earth, the
 torn, blasted 
earth, with a g
reasy shine und
er the sun's ra
ys; the earth i
s the backgroun
d of this restl
ess, gloomy wor
ld of automaton
s, our gasping 
is the scratchi
ng of a quill, 
our lips are dr
y, our heads ar
e debauched wit
h stupor--thus 
we stagger forw
ard, and into o
ur pierced and 
shattered souls
 bores the tort
uring image of 
the brown earth
 with the greas
y sun and the c
onvulsed and de
ad soldiers, wh
o lie there--it
 can't be helpe
d--who cry and 
clutch at our l
egs as we sprin
g away over the
m. We have lost
 all feeling fo
r one another. 
We can hardly c
ontrol ourselve
s when our hunt
ed glance light
s on the form o
f some other ma
n. We are insen
sible, dead men
, who through s
ome trick, some
 dreadful magic
, are still abl
e to run and to
 kill. A young 
Frenchman lags 
behind, he is o
vertaken, he pu
ts up his hands
, in one he sti
ll holds his re
volver--does he
 mean to shoot 
or to give hims
elf up?--a blow
 from a spade c
leaves through 
his face. A sec
ond sees it and
 tries to run f
arther; a bayon
et jabs into hi
s back. He leap
s in the air, h
is arms thrown 
wide, his mouth
 wide open, yel
ling; he stagge
rs, in his back
 the bayonet qu
ivers. A third 
throws away his
 rifle, cowers 
down with his h
ands before his
 eyes. He is le
ft behind with 
a few other pri
soners to carry
 off the wounde
d. Suddenly in 
the pursuit we 
reach the enemy
 line. We are s
o close on the 
heels of our re
treating enemie
s that we reach
 it almost at t
he same time as
 they. In this 
way we suffer f
ew casualties. 
A machine-gun b
arks, but is si
lenced with a b
omb. Neverthele
ss, the couple 
of seconds has 
sufficed to giv
e us five stoma
ch wounds. With
 the butt of hi
s rifle Kat sma
shes to pulp th
e face of one o
f the unwounded
 machine-gunner
s. We bayonet t
he others befor
e they have tim
e to get out th
eir bombs. Then
 thirstily we d
rink the water 
they have for c
ooling the gun.
 Everywhere wir
e-cutters are s
napping, planks
 are thrown acr
oss the entangl
ements, we jump
 through the na
rrow entrances 
into the trench
es. Haie strike
s his spade int
o the neck of a
 gigantic Frenc
hman and throws
 the first hand
-grenade; we du
ck behind a bre
astwork for a f
ew seconds, the
n the whole sec
tion of trench 
before us is em
pty. The next t
hrow whizzes ob
liquely over th
e corner and cl
ears a passage;
 as we run past
 we toss handfu
ls down into th
e dug-outs, the
 earth shudders
, it crashes, d
ully and stifle
d, we stumble o
ver slippery lu
mps of flesh, o
ver yielding bo
dies; I fall in
to an open bell
y on which lies
 a clean, new o
fficer's cap. T
he fight ceases
. We lose touch
 with the enemy
. We cannot sta
y here long but
 must retire un
der cover of ou
r artillery to 
our own positio
n. No sooner do
 we know this t
han we dive int
o the nearest d
ug-outs, and wi
th the utmost h
aste seize on w
hatever provisi
ons we can see,
 especially the
 tins of corned
 beef and butte
r, before we cl
ear out. We get
 back pretty we
ll. There has b
een no further 
attack by the e
nemy. We lie fo
r an hour panti
ng and resting 
before anyone s
peaks. We are s
o completely pl
ayed out that i
n spite of our 
great hunger we
 do not think o
f the provision
s. Then gradual
ly we become so
mething like me
n again. The co
rned beef over 
there is famous
 along the whol
e front. Occasi
onally it has b
een the chief r
eason for a fly
ing raid on our
 part, for our 
nourishment is 
generally very 
bad; we have a 
constant hunger
. We bagged fiv
e tins altogeth
er. The fellows
 over there are
 well looked af
ter; it seems a
 luxury to us w
ith our hunger-
pangs, our turn
ip jam, and mea
t so scarce tha
t we simply gra
b at it. Haie h
as scored a thi
n loaf of white
 French bread, 
and stuck it in
 behind his bel
t like a spade.
 It is a bit bl
oody at one cor
ner, but that c
an be cut off. 
It is a good th
ing we have som
ething decent t
o eat at last; 
we still have a
 use for all ou
r strength. Eno
ugh to eat is j
ust as valuable
 as a good dug-
out; it can sav
e our lives; th
at is the reaso
n we are so gre
edy for it. Tja
den has capture
d two water-bot
tles full of co
gnac. We pass t
hem round. * * 
The evening ben
ediction begins
. Night comes, 
out of the crat
ers rise the mi
sts. It looks a
s though the ho
les were full o
f ghostly secre
ts. The white v
apour creeps pa
infully round b
efore it ventur
es to steal awa
y over the edge
. Then long str
eaks stretch fr
om crater to cr
ater. It is chi
lly. I am on se
ntry and stare 
into the darkne
ss. My strength
 is exhausted a
s always after 
an attack, and 
so it is hard f
or me to be alo
ne with my thou
ghts. They are 
not properly th
oughts; they ar
e memories whic
h in my weaknes
s turn homeward
 and strangely 
move me. The pa
rachute-lights 
shoot upwards--
and I see a pic
ture, a summer 
evening, I am i
n the cathedral
 cloister and l
ook at the tall
 rose trees tha
t bloom in the 
middle of the l
ittle cloister 
garden where th
e monks lie bur
ied. Around the
 walls are the 
stone carvings 
of the Stations
 of the Cross. 
No one is there
. A great quiet
ness rules in t
his blossoming 
quadrangle, the
 sun lies warm 
on the heavy gr
ey stones, I pl
ace my hand upo
n them and feel
 the warmth. At
 the right-hand
 corner the gre
en cathedral sp
ire ascends int
o the pale blue
 sky of the eve
ning. Between t
he glowing colu
mns of the cloi
ster is the coo
l darkness that
 only churches 
have, and I sta
nd there and wo
nder whether, w
hen I am twenty
, I shall have 
experienced the
 bewildering em
otions of love.
 The image is a
larmingly near;
 it touches me 
before it disso
lves in the lig
ht of the next 
star-shell. I l
ay hold of my r
ifle to see tha
t it is in trim
. The barrel is
 wet, I take it
 in my hand and
 rub off the mo
isture with my 
fingers. Betwee
n the meadows b
ehind our town 
there stands a 
line of old pop
lars by a strea
m. They were vi
sible from a gr
eat distance, a
nd although the
y grew on one b
ank only, we ca
lled them the p
oplar avenue. E
ven as children
 we had a great
 love for them,
 they drew us v
aguely thither,
 we played trua
nt the whole da
y by them and l
istened to thei
r rustling. We 
sat beneath the
m on the bank o
f the stream an
d let our feet 
hang over in th
e bright, swift
 waters. The pu
re fragrance of
 the water and 
the melody of t
he wind in the 
poplars held ou
r fancies. We l
oved them dearl
y, and the imag
e of those days
 still makes my
 heart pause in
 its beating. I
t is strange th
at all the memo
ries that come 
have these two 
qualities. They
 are always com
pletely calm, t
hat is predomin
ant in them; an
d even if they 
are not really 
calm, they beco
me so. They are
 soundless appa
ritions that sp
eak to me, with
 looks and gest
ures, silently,
 without any wo
rd--and it is t
he alarm of the
ir silence that
 forces me to l
ay hold of my s
leeve and my ri
fle lest I shou
ld abandon myse
lf to the liber
ation and allur
ement in which 
my body would d
ilate and gentl
y pass away int
o the still for
ces that lie be
hind these thin
gs. They are qu
iet in this way
, because quiet
ness is so unat
tainable for us
 now. At the fr
ont there is no
 quietness and 
the curse of th
e front reaches
 so far that we
 never pass bey
ond it. Even in
 the remote dep
ots and rest-ar
eas the droning
 and the muffle
d noise of shel
ling is always 
in our ears. We
 are never so f
ar off that it 
is no more to b
e heard. But th
ese last few da
ys it has been 
unbearable. The
ir stillness is
 the reason why
 these memories
 of former time
s do not awaken
 desire so much
 as sorrow--a s
trange, inappre
hensible melanc
holy. Once we h
ad such desires
--but they retu
rn not. They ar
e past, they be
long to another
 world that is 
gone from us. I
n the barracks 
they called for
th a rebellious
, wild craving 
for their retur
n; for then the
y were still bo
und to us, we b
elonged to them
 and they to us
, even though w
e were already 
absent from the
m. They appeare
d in the soldie
rs' songs which
 we sang as we 
marched between
 the glow of th
e dawn and the 
black silhouett
es of the fores
ts to drill on 
the moor, they 
were a powerful
 remembrance th
at was in us an
d came from us.
 But here in th
e trenches they
 are completely
 lost to us. Th
ey arise no mor
e; we are dead 
and they stand 
remote on the h
orizon, they ar
e an apparition
, a mysterious 
reflection draw
ing us home, th
at we fear and 
love without ho
pe. They are st
rong and our de
sire is strong-
-but they are u
nattainable, an
d we know it. A
nd even if thes
e scenes of our
 youth were giv
en back to us w
e would hardly 
know what to do
. The tender, s
ecret influence
 that passed fr
om them into us
 could not aris
e again. We lon
g to be in them
 and to move in
 them; we long 
to remember and
 to love them a
nd to be stirre
d by the sight 
of them. But it
 would be like 
gazing at the p
hotograph of a 
dead comrade; t
hose are his fe
atures, it is h
is face, and th
e days we spent
 together take 
on a mournful l
ife in the memo
ry; but the man
 himself it is 
not. We could n
ever again, as 
the same beings
, take part in 
those scenes. I
t was not any r
ecognition of t
heir beauty and
 their signific
ance that attra
cted us, but th
e communion, th
e feeling of a 
comradeship wit
h the things an
d events of our
 existence, whi
ch cut us off a
nd made the wor
ld of our paren
ts a thing inco
mprehensible to
 us--for then w
e surrendered o
urselves to eve
nts and were lo
st in them, and
 the least litt
le thing was en
ough to carry u
s down the stre
am of eternity.
 Perhaps it was
 only the privi
lege of our you
th, but as yet 
we recognized n
o limits and sa
w nowhere an en
d. We had that 
thrill of expec
tation in the b
lood which unit
ed us with the 
course of our d
ays. To-day we 
would pass thro
ugh the scenes 
of our youth li
ke travellers. 
We are burnt up
 by hard facts;
 like tradesmen
 we understand 
distinctions, a
nd like butcher
s, necessities.
 We are no long
er untroubled--
we are indiffer
ent. We long to
 be there; but 
could we live t
here? We are fo
rlorn like chil
dren, and exper
ienced like old
 men, we are cr
ude and sorrowf
ul and superfic
ial--I believe 
we are lost. * 
* My hands grow
 cold and my fl
esh creeps; and
 yet the night 
is warm. Only t
he mist is cold
, this mysterio
us mist that tr
ails the dead b
efore us and su
cks from them t
heir last, cree
ping life. By m
orning they wil
l be pale and g
reen and their 
blood congealed
 and black. Sti
ll the parachut
e-rockets shoot
 up and cast th
eir pitiless li
ght over the st
ony landscape, 
which is full o
f craters and f
rozen lights li
ke a moon. The 
blood beneath m
y skin brings f
ear and restles
sness into my t
houghts. They b
ecome feeble an
d tremble, they
 desire warmth 
and life. They 
cannot endure w
ithout sympathy
 and communion,
 they are disor
dered before th
e naked picture
 of despair. I 
hear the rattle
 of the mess-ti
ns and immediat
ely feel a stro
ng desire for w
arm food; it wo
uld do me good 
and comfort me.
 Painfully I fo
rce myself to w
ait until I am 
relieved. Then 
I go into the d
ug-out and find
 a mug of barle
y. It is cooked
 in fat and tas
tes good, I eat
 it slowly. I r
emain quiet, th
ough the others
 are in a bette
r mood, for the
 shelling has d
ied down. * * T
he days go by a
nd the incredib
le hours follow
 one another as
 a matter of co
urse. Attacks a
lternate with c
ounter-attacks 
and slowly the 
dead pile up in
 the field of c
raters between 
the trenches. W
e are able to b
ring in most of
 the wounded th
at do not lie t
oo far off. But
 many have long
 to wait and we
 listen to them
 dying. For one
 of them we sea
rch two days in
 vain. He must 
be lying on his
 belly and unab
le to turn over
. Otherwise it 
is hard to unde
rstand why we c
annot find him;
 for it is only
 when a man has
 his mouth clos
e to the ground
 that it is imp
ossible to gaug
e the direction
 of his cry. He
 must have been
 badly hit--one
 of those nasty
 wounds, neithe
r so severe tha
t they exhaust 
the body at onc
e and a man dre
ams on in a hal
f-swoon, nor so
 light that a m
an endures the 
pain in the hop
e of becoming w
ell again. Kat 
thinks he has e
ither a broken 
pelvis or a sho
t through the s
pine. His chest
 cannot have be
en injured othe
rwise he would 
not have such s
trength to cry 
out. And if it 
were any other 
kind of wound i
t would be poss
ible to see him
 moving. He gro
ws gradually ho
arser. The voic
e sounds so des
perate that it 
prevails everyw
here. The first
 night some of 
our fellows go 
out three times
 to look for hi
m. But when the
y think they ha
ve located him 
and crawl acros
s, next time th
ey hear the voi
ce it seems to 
come from somew
here else altog
ether. We searc
h in vain until
 dawn. We scrut
inize the field
 all day with g
lasses, but dis
cover nothing. 
On the second d
ay the calls ar
e fainter; that
 will be becaus
e his lips and 
mouth have beco
me dry. Our com
pany commander 
has promised sp
ecial leave wit
h three days ex
tra to anyone w
ho finds him. T
hat is a powerf
ul inducement, 
but we would do
 all that is po
ssible without 
that; for his c
ry is terrible.
 Kat and Kropp 
even go out in 
the afternoon, 
and Albert gets
 the lobe of hi
s ear shot off 
in consequence.
 It is to no pu
rpose, they com
e back without 
him. It is easy
 to understand 
what he cries. 
At first he cal
led only for he
lp--the second 
night he must h
ave some deliri
um, he talks wi
th his wife and
 his children, 
we often detect
 the name Elise
. To-day he mer
ely weeps. By e
vening the voic
e dwindles to a
 croaking. But 
it persists sti
ll through the 
whole night. We
 hear it so dis
tinctly because
 the wind blows
 toward our lin
e. In the morni
ng when we supp
ose he must alr
eady have long 
gone to his res
t, there comes 
across to us on
e last gurgling
 rattle. The da
ys are hot and 
the dead lie un
buried. We cann
ot fetch them a
ll in, if we di
d we should not
 know what to d
o with them. Th
e shells will b
ury them. Many 
have their bell
ies swollen up 
like balloons. 
They hiss, belc
h, and make mov
ements. The gas
es in them make
 noises. The sk
y is blue and w
ithout clouds. 
In the evening 
it grows sultry
 and the heat r
ises from the e
arth. When the 
wind blows towa
rd us it brings
 the smell of b
lood, which is 
heavy and sweet
. This deathly 
exhalation from
 the shell hole
s seems to be a
 mixture of chl
oroform and put
refaction, and 
fills us with n
ausea and retch
ing. * * The ni
ghts become qui
et and the hunt
 for copper dri
ving-bands and 
the silken para
chutes of the F
rench star-shel
ls begins. Why 
the driving-ban
ds are so desir
able no one kno
ws exactly. The
 collectors mer
ely assert that
 they are valua
ble. Some have 
collected so ma
ny that they wi
ll stoop under 
the weight of t
hem when we go 
back. But Haie 
at least gives 
a reason. He in
tends to give t
hem to his girl
 to supplement 
her garters. At
 this the Fries
ians explode wi
th mirth. They 
slap their knee
s: "By Jove tho
ugh, he's a wit
, Haie is, he's
 got brains." T
jaden especiall
y can hardly co
ntain himself; 
he takes the la
rgest of the ri
ngs in his hand
 and every now 
and then puts h
is leg through 
it to show how 
much slack ther
e is. "Haie, ma
n, she must hav
e legs like, le
gs----" his tho
ughts mount som
ewhat higher, "
and a behind to
o she must have
, like a--like 
an elephant!" H
e cannot get ov
er it. "I wish 
I could play ho
t-hand with her
 once, my hat--
--" Haie beams,
 proud that his
 girl should re
ceive so much a
ppreciation. "S
he's a nice bit
," he says with
 self-satisfact
ion. The parach
utes are turned
 to more practi
cal uses. Accor
ding to the siz
e of the bust t
hree or perhaps
 four will make
 a blouse. Krop
p and I use the
m as handkerchi
efs. The others
 send them home
. If the women 
could see at wh
at risk these b
its of rag are 
often obtained,
 they would be 
horrified. Kat 
surprises Tjade
n endeavouring 
with perfect eq
uanimity to kno
ck the driving-
band off a dud.
 If anyone else
 had tried it t
he thing would 
have exploded, 
but Tjaden alwa
ys has his luck
 with him. One 
morning two but
terflies play i
n front of our 
trench. They ar
e brimstone-but
terflies, with 
red spots on th
eir yellow wing
s. What can the
y be looking fo
r here? There i
s not a plant n
or a flower for
 miles. They se
ttle on the tee
th of a skull. 
The birds too a
re just as care
free, they have
 long since acc
ustomed themsel
ves to the war.
 Every morning 
larks ascend fr
om No Man's Lan
d. A year ago w
e watched them 
nesting; the yo
ung ones grew u
p too. We have 
a spell from th
e rats in the t
rench. They are
 in No Man's La
nd--we know wha
t for. They gro
w fat; when we 
see one we have
 a crack at it.
 At night we he
ar again the ro
lling behind th
e enemy lines. 
All day we have
 only the norma
l shelling, so 
that we are abl
e to repair the
 trenches. Ther
e is always ple
nty of amusemen
t, the airmen s
ee to that. The
re are countles
s fights for us
 to watch every
 day. Battle pl
anes don't trou
ble us, but the
 observation pl
anes we hate li
ke the plague; 
they put the ar
tillery on to u
s. A couple of 
minutes after t
hey appear, shr
apnel and high-
explosives begi
n to drop on us
. We lose eleve
n men in one da
y that way, and
 five of them s
tretcher-bearer
s. Two are so s
mashed that Tja
den remarks you
 could scrape t
hem off the wal
l of the trench
 with a spoon a
nd bury them in
 a mess-tin. An
other has the l
ower part of hi
s body and his 
legs torn off. 
Dead, his chest
 leans against 
the side of the
 trench, his fa
ce is lemon-yel
low, in his bea
rd stills burns
 a cigarette. I
t glows until i
t dies out on h
is lips. We put
 the dead in a 
large shell-hol
e. So far there
 are three laye
rs, one on top 
of the other. *
 * Suddenly the
 shelling begin
s to pound agai
n. Soon we are 
sitting up once
 more with the 
rigid tenseness
 of blank antic
ipation. Attack
, counter-attac
k, charge, repu
lse--these are 
words, but what
 things they si
gnify! We have 
lost a good man
y men, mostly r
ecruits. Reinfo
rcements have a
gain been sent 
up to our secto
r. It is one of
 the new regime
nts, composed o
f young fellows
 called up duri
ng last year. T
hey have had ha
rdly any traini
ng, and are sen
t into the fiel
d with only a t
heoretical know
ledge. They do 
know what a han
d-grenade is, i
t is true, but 
they have very 
little idea of 
cover, and what
 is most import
ant of all, hav
e no eye for it
. A fold in the
 ground has to 
be quite eighte
en inches high 
before they can
 see it. Althou
gh we need rein
forcement, the 
recruits give u
s almost more t
rouble than the
y are worth. Th
ey are helpless
 in this grim f
ighting area, t
hey fall like f
lies. The prese
nt method of fi
ghting from pos
ts demands know
ledge and exper
ience; a man mu
st have a feeli
ng for the cont
ours of the gro
und, an ear for
 the sound and 
character of th
e shells, must 
be able to deci
de beforehand w
here they will 
drop, how they 
will burst, and
 how to shelter
 from them. The
 young recruits
 of course know
 none of these 
things. They ge
t killed simply
 because they c
an hardly tell 
shrapnel from h
igh-explosive, 
they are mown d
own because the
y are listening
 anxiously to t
he roar of the 
big coal-boxes 
falling far in 
the rear, and m
iss the light, 
piping whistle 
of the low spre
ading little da
isy-cutters. Th
ey flock togeth
er like sheep i
nstead of scatt
ering, and even
 the wounded ar
e shot down lik
e hares by the 
airmen. Their p
ale turnip face
s, their pitifu
l clenched hand
s, the miserabl
e courage of th
ese poor devils
, the desperate
 charges and at
tacks made by t
hese poor brave
 devils, who ar
e so terrified 
that they dare 
not cry out lou
dly, but with b
attered chests 
and torn bellie
s and arms and 
legs only whimp
er softly for t
heir mothers an
d cease as soon
 as one looks a
t them. Their s
harp, downy, de
ad faces have t
he awful expres
sionlessness of
 dead children.
 It brings a lu
mp into the thr
oat to see how 
they go over, a
nd run and fall
. A man would l
ike to spank th
em, they are so
 stupid, and to
 take them by t
he arm and lead
 them away from
 here where the
y have no busin
ess to be. They
 wear grey coat
s and trousers 
and boots, but 
for most of the
m the uniform i
s far too big, 
it hangs on the
ir limbs, their
 shoulders are 
too narrow, the
ir bodies too s
light; no unifo
rm was ever mad
e to these chil
dish measuremen
ts. Between fiv
e and ten recru
its fall to eve
ry old hand. A 
surprise gas-at
tack carries of
f a lot of them
. They have not
 yet learned wh
at to do. We fo
und one dug-out
 full of them, 
with blue heads
 and black lips
. Some of them 
in a shell hole
 took their mas
ks off too soon
; they did not 
know that the g
as lies longest
 in the hollows
; when they saw
 others on top 
without masks t
hey pulled thei
rs off too and 
swallowed enoug
h to scorch the
ir lungs. Their
 condition is h
opeless, they c
hoke to death w
ith hæmorrhages
 and suffocatio
n. * * In one p
art of the tren
ch I suddenly r
un into Himmels
toss. We dive i
nto the same du
g-out. Breathle
ss we are all l
ying one beside
 the other wait
ing for the cha
rge. When we ru
n out again, al
though I am ver
y excited, I su
ddenly think: "
Where's Himmels
toss?" Quickly 
I jump back int
o the dug-out a
nd find him wit
h a small scrat
ch lying in a c
orner pretendin
g to be wounded
. His face look
s sullen. He is
 in a panic; he
 is new to it t
oo. But it make
s me mad that t
he young recrui
ts should be ou
t there and he 
here. "Get out!
" I spit. He do
es not stir, hi
s lips quiver, 
his moustache t
witches. "Out!"
 I repeat. He d
raws up his leg
s, crouches bac
k against the w
all, and shows 
his teeth like 
a cur. I seize 
him by the arm 
and try to pull
 him up. He bar
ks. That is too
 much for me. I
 grab him by th
e neck and shak
e him like a sa
ck, his head je
rks from side t
o side. "You lu
mp, will you ge
t out--you houn
d, you skunk, s
neak out of it,
 would you?" Hi
s eye becomes g
lassy, I knock 
his head agains
t the wall--"Yo
u cow"--I kick 
him in the ribs
--"You swine"--
I push him towa
rd the door and
 shove him out 
head first. Ano
ther wave of ou
r attack has ju
st come up. A l
ieutenant is wi
th them. He see
s us and yells;
 "Forward, forw
ard, join in, f
ollow." And the
 word of comman
d does what all
 my banging cou
ld not. Himmels
toss hears the 
order, looks ro
und him as if a
wakened, and fo
llows on. I com
e after and wat
ch him go over.
 Once more he i
s the smart Him
melstoss of the
 parade-ground,
 he has even ou
tstripped the l
ieutenant and i
s far ahead. Bo
mbardment, barr
age, curtain-fi
re, mines, gas,
 tanks, machine
-guns, hand-gre
nades--words, w
ords, but they 
hold the horror
 of the world. 
Our faces are e
ncrusted, our t
houghts are dev
astated, we are
 weary to death
; when the atta
ck comes we sha
ll have to stri
ke many of the 
men with our fi
sts to waken th
em and make the
m come with us-
-our eyes are b
urnt, our hands
 are torn, our 
knees bleed, ou
r elbows are ra
w. How long has
 it been? Weeks
--months--years
? Only days. We
 see time pass 
in the colourle
ss faces of the
 dying, we cram
 food into us, 
we run, we thro
w, we shoot, we
 kill, we lie a
bout, we are fe
eble and spent,
 and nothing su
pports us but t
he knowledge th
at there are st
ill feebler, st
ill more spent,
 still more hel
pless ones ther
e who, with sta
ring eyes, look
 upon us as god
s that escape d
eath many times
. In the few ho
urs of rest we 
teach them. "Th
ere, see that w
aggle-top? That
's a mortar com
ing. Keep down,
 it will go cle
an over. But if
 it comes this 
way, then run f
or it. You can 
run from a mort
ar." We sharpen
 their ears to 
the malicious, 
hardly audible 
buzz of the sma
ller shells tha
t are not so ea
sily distinguis
hed. They must 
pick them out f
rom the general
 din by their i
nsect-like hum-
-we explain to 
them that these
 are far more d
angerous than t
he big ones tha
t can be heard 
long beforehand
. We show them 
how to take cov
er from aircraf
t, how to simul
ate a dead man 
when one is ove
rrun in an atta
ck, how to time
 hand-grenades 
so that they ex
plode half a se
cond before hit
ting the ground
; we teach them
 to fling thems
elves into hole
s as quick as l
ightning before
 the shells wit
h instantaneous
 fuses; we show
 them how to cl
ean up a trench
 with a handful
 of bombs; we e
xplain the diff
erence between 
the fuse-length
 of the enemy b
ombs and our ow
n; we put them 
wise to the sou
nd of gas shell
s;--show them a
ll the tricks t
hat can save th
em from death. 
They listen, th
ey are docile--
but when it beg
ins again, in t
heir excitement
 they do everyt
hing wrong. Hai
e Westhus drags
 off with a gre
at wound in his
 back through w
hich the lung p
ulses at every 
breath. I can o
nly press his h
and; "It's all 
up, Paul," he g
roans and bites
 his arm becaus
e of the pain. 
We see men livi
ng with their s
kulls blown ope
n; we see soldi
ers run with th
eir two feet cu
t off, they sta
gger on their s
plintered stump
s into the next
 shell-hole; a 
lance-corporal 
crawls a mile a
nd a half on hi
s hands draggin
g his smashed k
nee after him; 
another goes to
 the dressing s
tation and over
 his clasped ha
nds bulge his i
ntestines; we s
ee men without 
mouths, without
 jaws, without 
faces; we find 
one man who has
 held the arter
y of his arm in
 his teeth for 
two hours in or
der not to blee
d to death. The
 sun goes down,
 night comes, t
he shells whine
, life is at an
 end. Still the
 little piece o
f convulsed ear
th in which we 
lie is held. We
 have yielded n
o more than a f
ew hundred yard
s of it as a pr
ize to the enem
y. But on every
 yard there lie
s a dead man. *
 * We have been
 relieved. The 
wheels roll ben
eath us, we sta
nd dully, and w
hen the call "M
ind--wire" come
s, we bend our 
knees. It was s
ummer when we c
ame up, the tre
es were still g
reen, now it is
 autumn and the
 night is grey 
and wet. The lo
rries stop, we 
climb out--a co
nfused heap, a 
remnant of many
 names. On eith
er side stand p
eople, dark, ca
lling out the n
umbers of the r
egiments, the c
ompanies. And a
t each call a l
ittle group sep
arates itself o
ff, a small han
dful of dirty, 
pallid soldiers
, a dreadfully 
small handful, 
and a dreadfull
y small remnant
. Now someone i
s calling the n
umber of our co
mpany, it is, y
es, the Company
-Commander, he 
has got one too
, his arm is in
 a sling. We go
 over to him an
d I recognize K
at and Albert, 
we stand togeth
er, lean agains
t each other, a
nd look at one 
another. And we
 hear the numbe
r of our compan
y called again 
and again. He w
ill call a long
 time, they do 
not hear him in
 the hospitals 
and shell-holes
. Once again: "
Second Company,
 this way!" And
 then more soft
ly: "Nobody els
e Second Compan
y?" He is silen
t, and then hus
kily he says: "
Is that all?" a
nd gives the or
der: "Number!" 
The morning is 
grey, it was st
ill summer when
 we came up, an
d we were one h
undred and fift
y strong. Now w
e freeze, it is
 autumn, the le
aves rustle, th
e voices flutte
r out wearily: 
"One--two--thre
e--four----" an
d cease at thir
ty-two. And the
re is a long si
lence before th
e voice asks: "
Anyone else?"--
and waits and t
hen says softly
: "In squads---
-" and then bre
aks off and is 
only able to fi
nish: "Second C
ompany----" wit
h difficulty: "
Second Company-
-march easy!" A
 line, a short 
line trudges of
f into the morn
ing. Thirty-two
 men. CHAPTER V
II They have ta
ken us farther 
back than usual
 to a field dep
ot so that we c
an be re-organi
zed. Our compan
y needs more th
an a hundred re
inforcements. I
n the meantime,
 when we are of
f duty, we loaf
 around. After 
a couple of day
s Himmelstoss c
omes up to us. 
He has had the 
bounce knocked 
out of him sinc
e he has been i
n the trenches 
and wants to ge
t on good terms
 with us. I am 
willing enough,
 because I saw 
how he brought 
Haie Westhus in
 when he was hi
t in the back. 
Besides he's de
cent enough to 
treat us at the
 canteen when w
e are out of fu
nds. Only Tjade
n is still rese
rved and suspic
ious. But he is
 won over, too,
 when Himmelsto
ss tells us tha
t he is taking 
the place of th
e sergeant-cook
 who has gone o
n leave. As a p
roof he produce
s on the spot t
wo pounds of su
gar for us and 
a half-pound of
 butter special
ly for Tjaden. 
He even sees to
 it that we are
 detailed the n
ext two or thre
e days to the c
ook house for p
otato and turni
p peeling. The 
grub he gives u
s there is real
 officers' fare
. Thus for the 
moment we have 
the two things 
a soldier needs
 for contentmen
t: good food an
d rest. That's 
not much when o
ne comes to thi
nk of it. A cou
ple of years ag
o we would have
 despised ourse
lves terribly. 
But now we are 
quite happy. It
 is all a matte
r of habit--eve
n the front lin
e. Habit is the
 explanation of
 why we seem to
 forget things 
so quickly. Yes
terday we were 
under fire, to-
day we act the 
fool and go for
aging through t
he countryside,
 to-morrow we g
o up to the tre
nches again. We
 forget nothing
 really. But so
 long as we hav
e to stay here 
in the field, t
he front-line d
ays, when they 
are past, sink 
down in us like
 a stone; they 
are too serious
 for us to be a
ble to reflect 
on them at once
. If we did tha
t, we should ha
ve been destroy
ed long ago. I 
soon found out 
this much:--ter
ror can be endu
red so long as 
a man simply du
cks;--but it ki
lls, if a man t
hinks about it.
 Just as we tur
n into animals 
when we go up t
o the line, bec
ause that is th
e only thing wh
ich brings us t
hrough safely, 
so we turn into
 wags and loafe
rs when we are 
out resting. We
 can do nothing
 else, it is a 
sheer necessity
. We want to li
ve at any price
; so we cannot 
burden ourselve
s with feelings
 which, though 
they might be o
rnamental enoug
h in peace time
, would be out 
of place here. 
Kemmerich is de
ad, Haie Westhu
s is dying, the
y will have a j
ob with Hans Kr
amer's body at 
the Judgment Da
y, piecing it t
ogether after a
 direct hit; Ma
rtens has no le
gs any more, Me
yer is dead, Ma
x is dead, Beye
r is dead, Hamm
erling is dead,
 there are a hu
ndred and twent
y wounded men l
ying somewhere 
or other; it is
 a damnable bus
iness, but what
 has it to do w
ith us now--we 
live. If it wer
e possible for 
us to save them
, then it would
 be seen how mu
ch we cared--we
 would have a s
hot at it thoug
h we went under
 ourselves; for
 we can be damn
ed quixotic whe
n we like; fear
 we do not know
 much about--te
rror of death, 
yes; but that i
s a different m
atter, that is 
physical. But o
ur comrades are
 dead, we canno
t help them, th
ey have their r
est--and who kn
ows what is wai
ting for us? We
 will make ours
elves comfortab
le and sleep, a
nd eat as much 
as we can stuff
 into our belli
es, and drink a
nd smoke so tha
t the hours are
 not wasted. Li
fe is short. * 
* The terror of
 the front sink
s deep down whe
n we turn our b
acks upon it; w
e make grim, co
arse jests abou
t it, when a ma
n dies, then we
 say he had nip
ped off his tur
d, and so we sp
eak of everythi
ng; that keeps 
us from going m
ad; as long as 
we take it that
 way we maintai
n our own resis
tance. But we d
o not forget. I
t's all rot tha
t they put in t
he war-news abo
ut the good hum
our of the troo
ps, how they ar
e arranging dan
ces almost befo
re they are out
 of the front-l
ine. We don't a
ct like that be
cause we are in
 a good humour:
 we are in a go
od humour becau
se otherwise we
 should go to p
ieces. If it we
re not so we co
uld not hold ou
t much longer; 
our humour beco
mes more bitter
 every month. A
nd this I know:
 all these thin
gs that now, wh
ile we are stil
l in the war, s
ink down in us 
like a stone, a
fter the war sh
all waken again
, and then shal
l begin the dis
entanglement of
 life and death
. The days, the
 weeks, the yea
rs out here sha
ll come back ag
ain, and our de
ad comrades sha
ll then stand u
p again and mar
ch with us, our
 heads shall be
 clear, we shal
l have a purpos
e, and so we sh
all march, our 
dead comrades b
eside us, the y
ears at the Fro
nt behind us:--
against whom, a
gainst whom? * 
* Some time ago
 there was an a
rmy theatre in 
these parts. Co
loured posters 
of the performa
nces are still 
sticking on a h
oarding. With w
ide eyes Kropp 
and I stand in 
front of it. We
 can hardly cre
dit that such t
hings still exi
st. A girl in a
 light summer d
ress, with a re
d patent-leathe
r belt about he
r hips! She is 
standing with o
ne hand on a ra
iling and with 
the other she h
olds a straw ha
t. She wears wh
ite stockings a
nd white shoes,
 fine buckle sh
oes with high h
eels. Behind he
r smiles a blue
 lake with whit
e-horses, at th
e side is a bri
ght bay. She is
 a lovely girl 
with a delicate
 nose, red lips
, and slender l
egs, wonderfull
y clean and wel
l cared for, sh
e certainly bat
hes twice a day
 and never has 
any dirt under 
her nails. At m
ost perhaps a b
it of sand from
 the beach. Bes
ide her stands 
a man in white 
trousers, a blu
ejacket, and sa
ilor's cap; but
 he interests u
s much less. Th
e girl on the p
oster is a wond
er to us. We ha
ve quite forgot
ten that there 
are such things
, and even now 
we hardly belie
ve our eyes. We
 have seen noth
ing like it for
 years, nothing
 like it for ha
ppiness, beauty
, and joy. That
 is peace time,
 that is as it 
should be; we f
eel excited. "J
ust look at tho
se thin shoes t
hough, she coul
dn't march many
 miles in those
," I say, and t
hen begin to fe
el silly, for i
t is absurd to 
stand in front 
of a picture li
ke this and thi
nk of nothing b
ut marching. "H
ow old would sh
e be?" Kropp as
ks. "About twen
ty-two at the m
ost," I hazard.
 "Then she woul
d be older than
 us! She is not
 more than seve
nteen, let me t
ell you!" It gi
ves us goose-fl
esh. "That woul
d be good, Albe
rt, what do you
 think?" He nod
s. "I have some
 white trousers
 at home too." 
"White trousers
," say I, "but 
a girl like tha
t----" We look 
askance at one 
another. There'
s not much to b
oast of here--t
wo ragged, stai
ned, and dirty 
uniforms. It is
 hopeless to co
mpete. So we pr
oceed to tear t
he young man wi
th the white tr
ousers off the 
hoarding, takin
g care not to d
amage the girl.
 That is someth
ing towards it.
 "We could go a
nd get deloused
, anyway," Krop
p then suggests
. I am not very
 enthusiastic b
ecause it doesn
't do one's clo
thes any good a
nd a man is lou
sy again inside
 two hours. But
 when we have c
onsidered the p
icture once mor
e, I declare my
self willing. I
 even go farthe
r. "We might se
e if we could g
et a clean shir
t as well----" 
"Socks might be
 better," says 
Albert, not wit
hout reason. "Y
es, socks too p
erhaps. Let's g
o and explore a
 bit." Then Lee
r and Tjaden st
roll up; they l
ook at the post
er and immediat
ely the convers
ation becomes s
mutty. Leer was
 the first of o
ur class to hav
e intercourse, 
and he gave sti
rring details o
f it. After his
 fashion he enj
oys himself ove
r the picture, 
and Tjaden supp
orts him nobly.
 It does not di
stress us exact
ly. Who isn't s
mutty is no sol
dier; it merely
 does not suit 
us at the momen
t, so we edge a
way and march o
ff to the delou
sing station wi
th the same fee
ling as if it w
ere a swell gen
tlemen's outfit
ters. * * The h
ouses in which 
we are billeted
 lie near the c
anal. On the ot
her side of the
 canal there ar
e ponds flanked
 with poplars;-
-on the other s
ide of the cana
l there are wom
en too. The hou
ses on our side
 have been aban
doned. On the o
ther side thoug
h one occasiona
lly sees inhabi
tants. In the e
vening we go sw
imming. Three w
omen come strol
ling along the 
bank. They walk
 slowly and don
't look away, a
lthough we have
 no bathing sui
ts. Leer calls 
out to them. Th
ey laugh and st
op to watch us.
 We fling remar
ks at them in b
roken French, a
nything that co
mes into our he
ads, hastily an
d all jumbled t
ogether, anythi
ng to detain th
em. They are no
t specially won
derful pieces, 
but then where 
are such to be 
had about here?
 There is one s
lim little brun
ette. Her teeth
 gleam when she
 laughs. She ha
s quick movemen
ts, her dress s
wings loosely a
bout her legs. 
Although the wa
ter is cold we 
are very jovial
 and do our bes
t to interest t
hem so that the
y will stay. We
 try to make jo
kes and they an
swer with thing
s we cannot und
erstand; we lau
gh and beckon. 
Tjaden is more 
crafty. He runs
 into the house
, gets a loaf o
f army bread an
d holds it up. 
That produces a
 great effect. 
They nod and be
ckon us to come
 over. But we d
on't dare to do
 that. It is fo
rbidden to cros
s to the opposi
te bank. There 
are sentries on
 all the bridge
s. It's impossi
ble without a p
ass. So we indi
cate that they 
should come ove
r to us; but th
ey shake their 
heads and point
 to the bridge.
 They are not a
llowed to pass 
either. They tu
rn away and wal
k slowly down t
he canal, keepi
ng along the to
w-path all the 
way. We accompa
ny them swimmin
g. After a few 
hundred yards t
hey turn off an
d point to a ho
use that stands
 a little dista
nce away among 
the trees and s
hrubbery. Leer 
asks if they li
ve there. They 
laugh--sure, th
at's their hous
e. We call out 
to them that we
 would like to 
come, sometime 
when the guards
 cannot see us.
 At night. To-n
ight. They rais
e their hands, 
put them togeth
er, rest their 
faces on them a
nd shut their e
yes. They under
stand. The slim
 brunette does 
a two-step. The
 blonde girl tw
itters: "Bread-
-good----" Eage
rly we assure t
hem that we wil
l bring some wi
th us. And othe
r tasty bits to
o, we roll our 
eyes and try to
 explain with o
ur hands. Leer 
nearly drowns t
rying to demons
trate a sausage
. If it were ne
cessary we woul
d promise them 
a whole quarter
master's store.
 They go off an
d frequently tu
rn and look bac
k. We climb out
 on the bank on
 our side of th
e canal and wat
ch to see wheth
er they go into
 the house for 
they might easi
ly have been ly
ing. Then we sw
im back. No one
 can cross the 
bridge without 
leave, so we wi
ll simply have 
to swim over at
 night. We are 
full of excitem
ent. We cannot 
last out withou
t a drink, so w
e go to the can
teen where ther
e is beer and a
 kind of punch.
 We drink punch
 and tell one a
nother lying ta
les of our expe
riences. Each m
an gladly belie
ves the other m
an's story, onl
y waiting impat
iently till he 
can cap it with
 a taller one. 
Our hands are f
idgety, we smok
e countless cig
arettes, until 
Kropp says: "We
 might as well 
take them a cou
ple of cigarett
es too." So we 
put some inside
 our caps to ke
ep them. The sk
y turns apple-g
reen. There are
 four of us, bu
t only three ca
n go; we must s
hake off Tjaden
, so ply him wi
th rum and punc
h until he rock
s. As it turns 
dark we go to o
ur billets, Tja
den in the cent
re. We are all 
glowing and ful
l of a lust for
 adventure. The
 little brunett
e is mine, we s
ettled that by 
cutting for her
. Tjaden drops 
on his sack of 
straw and snore
s. Once he wake
s up and grins 
so craftily tha
t we are alarme
d and begin to 
think he is che
ating, and that
 we have given 
him the punch t
o no purpose. T
hen he drops ba
ck again and sl
eeps on. We eac
h get hold of a
 whole army loa
f and wrap it u
p in newspaper.
 The cigarettes
 we put in too,
 as well as thr
ee good rations
 of liver-sausa
ge that were is
sued to us this
 evening. That 
makes a decent 
present. We sto
w the things ca
refully in our 
boots; we have 
to take them to
 protect our fe
et against trea
ding on wire an
d broken glass 
on the other ba
nk. As we must 
swim for it we 
can take no oth
er clothes. But
 it is not far 
and quite dark.
 We make off wi
th our boots in
 our hands. Swi
ftly we slip in
to the water, l
ie on our backs
 and swim, hold
ing the boots w
ith their conte
nts up over our
 heads. We clim
b out carefully
 on the opposit
e bank, take ou
t the packages 
and put on our 
boots. We put t
he things under
 our arms. And 
so, all wet and
 naked, clothed
 only in our bo
ots, we break i
nto a trot. We 
find the house 
at once. It lie
s among the tre
es. Leer trips 
over a root and
 skins his elbo
ws. "No matter,
" he says gaily
. The windows a
re shuttered. W
e slip round th
e house and try
 to peer throug
h the cracks. T
hen we grow imp
atient. Suddenl
y Kropp hesitat
es: "What if th
ere's a Major i
n with them?" "
Then we just cl
ear off," grins
 Leer, "he can 
try to read our
 regimental num
bers here," and
 smacks his beh
ind. The door o
f the court-yar
d stands open. 
Our boots make 
a great clatter
. The house doo
r opens, a chin
k of light shin
es through and 
a woman cries o
ut in a scared 
voice. "Ssh, ss
h! camerade--bo
n ami--" we say
, and show our 
packages protes
tingly. The oth
er two are now 
on the scene, t
he door opens w
ide and the lig
ht floods over 
us. They recogn
ize us and all 
three burst int
o laughter at o
ur appearance. 
They rock and s
way in the door
way, they laugh
 so much. How s
upple their mov
ements are! "Un
 moment--" They
 disappear and 
throw us bits o
f clothing whic
h we gladly wra
p round ourselv
es. Then we ven
ture in. A smal
l lamp burns in
 the room, whic
h is warm and s
mells a little 
of perfume. We 
unwrap our parc
els and hand th
em over to the 
women. Their ey
es shine, it is
 obvious that t
hey are hungry.
 Then we all be
come rather emb
arrassed. Leer 
makes the gestu
res of eating, 
and then they c
ome to life aga
in and bring ou
t plates and kn
ives and fall t
o on the food, 
and they hold u
p every slice o
f liver-sausage
 and admire it 
before they eat
 it, and we sit
 proudly by. Th
ey overwhelm us
 with their cha
tter;--we under
stand very litt
le of it, but w
e listen and th
e words sound f
riendly. No dou
bt we all look 
very young. The
 little brunett
e strokes my ha
ir and says wha
t all the Frenc
h women say: "L
a guerre--grand
 malheur--pauvr
es garçons----"
 I hold her arm
 tightly and pr
ess my lips int
o the palm of h
er hand. Her fi
ngers close rou
nd my face. Clo
se above me are
 her bewilderin
g eyes, the sof
t brown of her 
skin and her re
d lips. Her mou
th speaks words
 I do not under
stand. Nor do I
 fully understa
nd her eyes; th
ey seem to say 
more than we an
ticipated when 
we came here. T
here are other 
rooms adjoining
. In passing I 
see Leer, he ha
s made a great 
hit with the bl
onde. And he kn
ows it, too. Bu
t I--I am lost 
in remoteness, 
in weakness, an
d in a passion 
to which I yiel
d myself trusti
ngly. My desire
s are strangely
 compounded of 
yearning and mi
sery. I feel gi
ddy, there is n
othing here tha
t a man can hol
d on to. We hav
e left our boot
s at the door, 
they have given
 us slippers in
stead, and now 
nothing remains
 to recall for 
me the assuranc
e and self-conf
idence of the s
oldier: no rifl
e, no belt, no 
tunic, no cap. 
I let myself dr
op into the unk
nown, come what
 may--yet, in s
pite of all, I 
feel somewhat a
fraid. The litt
le brunette con
tracts her brow
s when she is t
hinking; but wh
en she talks th
ey are still. A
nd often the so
und does not qu
ite become a wo
rd but suffocat
es or floats aw
ay over me half
-finished; an a
rch, a pathway,
 a comet. What 
have I known of
 it--what do I 
know of it?--Th
e words of this
 foreign tongue
, that I hardly
 understand, th
ey caress me to
 a quietness, i
n which the roo
m grows dim, an
d dissolves in 
the half light,
 and only the f
ace above me li
ves and is clea
r. How various 
is a face; but 
an hour ago it 
was strange and
 now it is touc
hed with a tend
erness that com
es, not from it
, but out of th
e night, the wo
rld and the blo
od, all these t
hings seem to s
hine in it toge
ther. The objec
ts in the room 
are touched by 
it and transfor
med, they becom
e isolated, and
 I feel almost 
awed at the sig
ht of my clear 
skin when the l
ight of the lam
p falls upon it
 and the cool, 
brown hand pass
es over it. How
 different all 
this is from th
e conditions in
 the soldier's 
brothels, to wh
ich we are allo
wed to go, and 
where we have t
o wait in long 
queues. I wish 
I never thought
 of them; but d
esire turns my 
mind to them in
voluntarily and
 I am afraid, f
or it might be 
impossible ever
 to be free of 
them again. But
 then I feel th
e lips of the l
ittle brunette 
and press mysel
f against them,
 my eyes close 
and I let it al
l fall from me,
 war and terror
 and grossness,
 in order to aw
aken young and 
happy; I think 
of the picture 
of the girl on 
the poster and,
 for a moment, 
believe that my
 life depends o
n winning her. 
And if I press 
ever deeper int
o the arms that
 embrace me, pe
rhaps a miracle
 may happen....
 . . . . . . . 
. So, after a t
ime we find our
selves reassemb
led again. Leer
 is in high spi
rits. We pull o
n our boots and
 take our leave
 warmly. The ni
ght air cools o
ur hot bodies. 
The rustling po
plars loom larg
e in the darkne
ss. The moon fl
oats in the hea
vens and in the
 waters of the 
canal. We do no
t run, we walk 
beside one anot
her with long s
trides. "That w
as worth a rati
on-loaf," says 
Leer. I cannot 
trust myself to
 speak, I am no
t in the least 
happy. Then we 
hear footsteps 
and dodge behin
d a shrub. The 
steps come near
er, close by us
. We see a nake
d soldier, in b
oots, just like
 ourselves; he 
has a package u
nder his arm, a
nd gallops onwa
rd. It is Tjade
n in full cours
e. He has disap
peared already.
 We laugh. In t
he morning he w
ill curse us. U
nobserved, we a
rrive again at 
our sacks of st
raw. * * I am c
alled to the Or
derly Room. The
 Company Comman
der gives me a 
leave-pass and 
a travel-pass a
nd wishes me a 
good journey. I
 look to see ho
w much leave I 
have got. Seven
teen days--four
teen days leave
 and three days
 for travelling
. It is not eno
ugh and I ask w
hether I cannot
 have five days
 for travelling
. Bertinck poin
ts to my pass. 
There I see tha
t I am not to r
eturn to the fr
ont immediately
. After my leav
e I have to rep
ort for a cours
e of training t
o a camp on the
 moors. The oth
ers congratulat
e me. Kat gives
 me good advice
, and tells me 
I ought to try 
to get a base-j
ob. "If you are
 smart, you'll 
hang on to it."
 I would rather
 not have gone 
for another eig
ht days; we are
 to stay here t
hat much longer
 and it is good
 here. Naturall
y I have to sta
nd the others d
rinks at the ca
nteen. We are a
ll a little bit
 drunk. I becom
e gloomy: I wil
l be away for s
ix weeks-- That
 is lucky of co
urse, but what 
may happen befo
re I get back? 
Shall I meet al
l these fellows
 again? Already
 Haie has gone-
-who will the n
ext be? As we d
rink, I look at
 each of them i
n turn. Albert 
sits beside me 
and smokes, he 
is silent, we h
ave always been
 together;--opp
osite squats Ka
t, with his dro
oping shoulders
, his broad thu
mb, and calm vo
ice--Müller wit
h the protrudin
g teeth and the
 booming laugh;
 Tjaden with hi
s mousey eyes;-
-Leer who has g
rown a full bea
rd and looks at
 least forty. O
ver us hangs a 
dense cloud of 
smoke. Where wo
uld a soldier b
e without tobac
co. The canteen
 is his refuge,
 and beer is fa
r more than a d
rink, it is a t
oken that a man
 can move his l
imbs and stretc
h in safety. We
 do it ceremoni
ally, we stretc
h our legs out 
in front of us 
and spit delibe
rately, that is
 the only way. 
How it all rise
s up before a m
an when he is g
oing away the n
ext morning! At
 night we go ag
ain to the othe
r side of the c
anal. I am almo
st afraid to te
ll the little b
runette that I 
am going away, 
and when I retu
rn we will cert
ainly be far aw
ay from here; w
e will never se
e one another a
gain. But she m
erely nods and 
takes no specia
l notice. At fi
rst I am at a l
oss to understa
nd, then it sud
denly dawns on 
me. Yes, Leer i
s right: if I w
ere going up to
 the front, the
n she would hav
e again called 
me "pauvre garç
on"; but merely
 going on leave
--she does not 
want to hear ab
out that, that 
is not nearly s
o interesting. 
May she go to t
he devil with h
er chattering t
alk. A man drea
ms of a miracle
 and wakes up t
o loaves of bre
ad. Next mornin
g, after I have
 been de-loused
, I go to the r
ail head. Alber
t and Kat come 
with me. At the
 halt we learn 
that it will be
 a couple of ho
urs yet before 
the train leave
s. The other tw
o have to go ba
ck to duty. We 
take leave of o
ne another. "Go
od luck, Kat; g
ood luck, Alber
t." They go off
 and wave once 
or twice. Their
 figures dwindl
e. I know their
 every step and
 movement; I wo
uld recognize t
hem at any dist
ance. Then they
 disappear. I s
it down on my p
ack and wait. S
uddenly I becom
e filled with a
 consuming impa
tience to be go
ne. * * I lie d
own on many a s
tation platform
; I stand befor
e many a soup-k
itchen; I squat
 on many a benc
h;--then at las
t the landscape
 becomes gloomy
, mysterious, a
nd familiar. It
 glides past th
e western windo
ws with its vil
lages, their th
atched roofs li
ke caps, pulled
 over the white
-washed, half-t
imbered houses,
 its corn-field
s, gleaming lik
e mother-of-pea
rl in the slant
ing light, its 
orchards, its b
arns and old li
me trees. The n
ames of the sta
tions begin to 
take on meaning
 and my heart t
rembles. The tr
ain stamps and 
stamps onward, 
I stand at the 
window and hold
 on to the fram
e. These names 
mark the bounda
ries of my yout
h. Smooth meado
ws, fields, far
m-yards; a soli
tary team moves
 against the sk
y-line along th
e road that run
s parallel to t
he horizon--a b
arrier, before 
which peasants 
stand waiting, 
girls waving, c
hildren playing
 on the embankm
ent, roads, lea
ding into the c
ountry, smooth 
roads without a
rtillery. It is
 evening, and i
f the train did
 not rattle I s
hould cry out. 
The plain unfol
ds itself. In t
he distance, th
e soft, blue si
lhouette of the
 mountain range
s begins to app
ear. I recogniz
e the character
istic outline o
f the Dolbenber
g, a jagged com
b, springing up
 precipitously 
from the limit 
of the forests.
 Behind it shou
ld lie the town
. But now the s
un streams thro
ugh the world, 
dissolving ever
ything in its g
olden-red light
, the train swi
ngs round one c
urve and then a
nother;--far aw
ay, in a long l
ine one behind 
the other, stan
d the poplars, 
unsubstantial, 
swaying and dar
k, fashioned ou
t of shadow, li
ght, and desire
. The field swi
ngs round as th
e train encircl
es it, and the 
intervals betwe
en the trees di
minish; the tre
es become a blo
ck and for a mo
ment I see one 
only--then they
 reappear from 
behind the fore
most tree and s
tand out a long
 line against t
he sky until th
ey are hidden b
y the first hou
ses. A street-c
rossing. I stan
d at the window
, I cannot drag
 myself away. T
he others put t
heir baggage re
ady for getting
 out. I repeat 
to myself the n
ame of the Stre
et that we cros
s ever--Bremers
trasse--Bremers
trasse-- Below 
there are cycli
sts, lorries, m
en; it is a gre
y street and a 
grey subway;--i
t embraces me a
s though it wer
e my mother. Th
en the train st
ops, and there 
is the station 
with noise and 
cries and sentr
ies. I pick up 
my pack and fas
ten the straps,
 I take my rifl
e in my hand an
d stumble down 
the steps. On t
he platform I l
ook round; I kn
ow no one among
 all the people
 hurrying to an
d fro. A red-cr
oss sister offe
rs me something
 to drink. I tu
rn away, she sm
iles at me too 
foolishly, so o
bsessed with he
r own importanc
e: "Just look, 
I am giving a s
oldier coffee!"
--She calls me 
"Comrade," but 
I will have non
e of it. Outsid
e in front of t
he station the 
stream roars al
ongside the str
eet, it rushes 
foaming from th
e sluices of th
e mill bridge. 
There stands th
e old, square w
atch-tower, in 
front of it the
 great mottled 
lime tree and b
ehind it the ev
ening. Here we 
have often sat-
-how long ago i
t is--; we have
 passed over th
is bridge and b
reathed the coo
l, acid smell o
f the stagnant 
water; we have 
leaned over the
 still water on
 this side of t
he lock, where 
the green creep
ers and weeds h
ang from the pi
les of the brid
ge;--and on hot
 days we rejoic
ed in the spout
ing foam on the
 other side of 
the lock and to
ld tales about 
our school-teac
hers. I pass ov
er the bridge, 
I look right an
d left; the wat
er is as full o
f weeds as ever
, and it still 
shoots over in 
gleaming arches
; in the tower-
building laundr
esses still sta
nd with bare ar
ms as they used
 to over the cl
ean linen, and 
the heat from t
he ironing pour
s out through t
he open windows
. Dogs trot alo
ng the narrow s
treet, before t
he doors of the
 houses people 
stand and follo
w me with their
 gaze as I pass
 by, dirty and 
heavy laden. In
 this confectio
ner's we used t
o eat ices, and
 there we learn
ed to smoke cig
arettes. Walkin
g down the stre
et I know every
 shop, the colo
nial warehouse,
 the chemist's,
 the tobacconis
t's. Then at la
st I stand befo
re the brown do
or with its wor
n latch and my 
hand grows heav
y. I open the d
oor and a wonde
rful freshness 
comes out to me
et me, my eyes 
are dim. The st
airs creak unde
r my boots. Ups
tairs a door ra
ttles, someone 
is looking over
 the railing. I
t is the kitche
n door that was
 opened, they a
re cooking pota
to-cakes, the h
ouse reeks of i
t, and to-day o
f course is Sat
urday; that wil
l be my sister 
leaning over. F
or a moment I a
m shy and lower
 my head, then 
I take off my h
elmet and look 
up. Yes, it is 
my eldest siste
r. "Paul," she 
cries, "Paul---
-" I nod, my pa
ck bumps agains
t the banisters
; my rifle is s
o heavy. She pu
lls a door open
 and calls: "Mo
ther, mother, P
aul is here." I
 can go no furt
her--mother, mo
ther, Paul is h
ere. I lean aga
inst the wall a
nd grip my helm
et and rifle. I
 hold them as t
ight as I can, 
but I cannot ta
ke another step
, the staircase
 fades before m
y eyes, I suppo
rt myself with 
the butt of my 
rifle against m
y feet and clen
ch my teeth fie
rcely, but I ca
nnot speak a wo
rd, my sister's
 call has made 
me powerless, I
 can do nothing
, I struggle to
 make myself la
ugh, to speak, 
but no word com
es, and so I st
and on the step
s, miserable, h
elpless, paraly
sed, and agains
t my will the t
ears run down m
y cheeks. My si
ster comes back
 and says: "Why
, what is the m
atter?" Then I 
pull myself tog
ether and stagg
er on to the la
nding. I lean m
y rifle in a co
rner, I set my 
pack against th
e wall, place m
y helmet on it,
 and fling down
 my equipment a
nd baggage. The
n I say fiercel
y: "Bring me a 
handkerchief." 
She gives me on
e from the cupb
oard and I dry 
my face. Above 
me on the wall 
hangs the glass
 case with the 
coloured butter
flies that once
 I collected. N
ow I hear my mo
ther's voice. I
t comes from th
e bedroom. "Is 
she in bed?" I 
ask my sister. 
"She is ill--" 
she replies. I 
go in to her, g
ive her my hand
 and say as cal
mly as I can: "
Here I am, moth
er." She lies s
till in the dim
 light. Then sh
e asks anxiousl
y: "Are you wou
nded?" and I fe
el her searchin
g glance. "No, 
I have got leav
e." My mother i
s very pale. I 
am afraid to ma
ke a light. "He
re I lie now," 
says she, "and 
cry instead of 
being glad." "A
re you sick, mo
ther?" I ask. "
I am going to g
et up a little 
to-day," she sa
ys and turns to
 my sister, who
 is continually
 running to the
 kitchen to wat
ch that the foo
d does not burn
: "And put out 
the jar of pres
erved whortlebe
rries--you like
 that, don't yo
u?" she asks me
. "Yes, mother,
 I haven't had 
any for a long 
time." "We migh
t almost have k
nown you were c
oming," laughs 
my sister, "the
re is just your
 favourite dish
, potato-cakes,
 and even whort
le-berries to g
o with them too
." "And it is S
aturday," I add
. "Sit here bes
ide me," says m
y mother. She l
ooks at me. Her
 hands are whit
e and sickly an
d frail compare
d with mine. We
 say very littl
e, and I am tha
nkful that she 
asks nothing. W
hat ought I to 
say? Everything
 I could have w
ished for has h
appened. I have
 come out of it
 safely and sit
 here beside he
r. And in the k
itchen stands m
y sister making
 the evening br
ead and singing
. "Dear boy," s
ays my mother s
oftly. We were 
never very demo
nstrative in ou
r family; poor 
folk who toil a
nd are full of 
cares are not s
o. It is not th
eir way to prot
est what they a
lready know. Wh
en my mother sa
ys to me "dear 
boy," it means 
much more than 
when another us
es it. I know w
ell enough that
 the jar of who
rtleberries is 
the only one th
ey have had for
 months, and th
at she has kept
 it for me; and
 the somewhat s
tale cakes that
 she gives me t
oo. She has tak
en a favourable
 opportunity of
 getting a few 
and has put the
m all by for me
. I sit by her 
bed, and throug
h the window th
e chestnut tree
s in the beer g
arden opposite 
glow in brown a
nd gold. I brea
the deeply and 
say over to mys
elf:--"You are 
at home, you ar
e at home." But
 a sense of str
angeness will n
ot leave me, I 
can find nothin
g of myself in 
all these thing
s. There is my 
mother, there i
s my sister, th
ere my case of 
butterflies, an
d there the mah
ogany piano--bu
t I am not myse
lf there. There
 is a distance,
 a veil between
 us. I go and f
etch my pack to
 the bedside an
d turn out the 
things I have b
rought--a whole
 Edamer cheese,
 that Kat provi
ded me with, tw
o loaves of arm
y bread, three-
quarters of a p
ound of butter,
 two tins of li
ver-sausage, a 
pound of drippi
ng and a little
 bag of rice. "
I suppose you c
an make some us
e of that----" 
They nod. "Is i
t pretty bad fo
r food here?" I
 enquire. "Yes,
 there's not mu
ch. Do you get 
enough out ther
e?" I smile and
 point to the t
hings I have br
ought. "Not alw
ays quite so mu
ch as that, of 
course, but we 
fare reasonably
 well." Erna go
es out to bring
 in the food. S
uddenly my moth
er seizes hold 
of my hand and 
asks falteringl
y: "Was it very
 bad out there,
 Paul?" Mother,
 what should I 
answer to that!
 You would not 
understand, and
 never realize 
it. And you nev
er should reali
ze it. Was it b
ad, you ask.--Y
ou, Mother,--I 
shake my head a
nd say: "No, mo
ther, not so ve
ry. There are a
lways a lot of 
us together so 
it isn't so bad
." "Yes, but He
inrich Bredemey
er was here jus
t lately and he
 said it was te
rrible out ther
e now, with the
 gas and all th
e rest of it." 
It is my mother
 who says that.
 She says: "Wit
h the gas and a
ll the rest of 
it." She does n
ot know what sh
e is saying, sh
e is merely anx
ious for me. Sh
ould I tell her
 how we once fo
und three enemy
 trenches with 
their garrison 
all stiff as th
ough stricken w
ith apoplexy? A
gainst the para
pet, in the dug
outs, just wher
e they were, th
e men stood and
 lay about, wit
h blue faces, d
ead. "No, mothe
r, that's only 
talk," I answer
, "there's not 
very much in wh
at Bredemeyer s
ays. You see fo
r instance, I'm
 well and fit--
--" Before my m
other's tremulo
us anxiety I re
cover my compos
ure. Now I can 
walk about and 
talk and answer
 questions with
out fear of hav
ing suddenly to
 lean against t
he wall because
 the world turn
s soft as rubbe
r and my veins 
become brimston
e. My mother wa
nts to get up. 
So I go for a w
hile to my sist
er in the kitch
en. "What is th
e matter with h
er?" I ask. She
 shrugs her sho
ulders: "She ha
s been in bed t
wo months now, 
but we did not 
want to write a
nd tell you. Se
veral doctors h
ave been to see
 her. One of th
em said it is p
robably cancer 
again." * * I g
o to the distri
ct commandant t
o report myself
. Slowly I wand
er through the 
streets. Occasi
onally someone 
speaks to me. I
 do not delay l
ong for I have 
little inclinat
ion to talk. On
 my way back fr
om the barracks
 a loud voice c
alls out to me.
 Still lost in 
thought I turn 
round and find 
myself confront
ed by a Major. 
"Can't you salu
te?" he bluster
s. "Sorry, Majo
r," I say in em
barrassment, "I
 didn't notice 
you." "Don't yo
u know how to s
peak properly?"
 he roars. I wo
uld like to hit
 him in the fac
e, but control 
myself, for my 
leave depends o
n it. I click m
y heels and say
: "I did not se
e you, Herr Maj
or." "Then keep
 your eyes open
," he snorts. "
What is your na
me?" I give it.
 His fat red fa
ce is furious. 
"What regiment?
" I give him fu
ll particulars.
 Even yet he ha
s not had enoug
h. "Where are t
hey?" But I hav
e had more than
 enough and say
: "Between Lang
emark and Bixsc
hoote." "Eh?" h
e asks, a bit s
tupefied. I exp
lain to him tha
t I arrived on 
leave only an h
our or two sinc
e, thinking tha
t he would then
 trot along. Bu
t not at all. H
e gets even mor
e furious: "You
 think you can 
bring your fron
t-line manners 
here, what? Wel
l, we don't sta
nd that sort of
 thing. Thank G
od, we have dis
cipline here!" 
"Twenty paces b
ackwards, doubl
e march!" he co
mmands. I am ma
d with rage. Bu
t I cannot say 
anything to him
; he could put 
me under arrest
 if he liked. S
o I double back
, and then marc
h up to him. Si
x paces from hi
m I spring to a
 stiff salute a
nd maintain it 
until I am six 
paces beyond hi
m. He calls me 
back again and 
affably gives m
e to understand
 that for once 
he is pleased t
o put mercy bef
ore justice. I 
pretend to be d
uly grateful. "
Now, dismiss!" 
he says. I turn
 about smartly 
and march off. 
That ruins the 
evening for me.
 I go back home
 and throw my u
niform into a c
orner; I ought 
to have done th
at before. Then
 I take out my 
civilian clothe
s from the ward
robe and put th
em on. I feel a
wkward. The sui
t is rather tig
ht and short, I
 have grown in 
the army. Colla
r and tie give 
me some trouble
. In the end my
 sister ties th
e bow for me. B
ut how light th
e suit is, it f
eels as though 
I had nothing o
n but a shirt a
nd underpants. 
I look at mysel
f in the glass.
 It is a strang
e sight. A sunb
urnt, overgrown
 candidate for 
confirmation ga
zes at me in as
tonishment. My 
mother is pleas
ed to see me we
aring civilian 
clothes; it mak
es me less stra
nge to her. But
 my father woul
d rather I kept
 my uniform on 
so that he coul
d take me to vi
sit his acquain
tances. But I r
efuse. * * It i
s pleasant to s
it quietly some
where, in the b
eer-garden for 
example, under 
the chestnuts b
y the skittle-a
lley. The leave
s fall down on 
the table and o
n the ground, o
nly a few, the 
first. A glass 
of beer stands 
in front of me,
 I've learned t
o drink in the 
army. The glass
 is half empty,
 but there are 
still a few goo
d swigs ahead o
f me, and besid
es I can always
 order a second
 and a third if
 I wish to. The
re are no bugle
s and no bombar
dments, the chi
ldren of the ho
use play in the
 skittle-alley,
 and the dog re
sts his head ag
ainst my knee. 
The sky is blue
, between the l
eaves of the ch
estnuts rises t
he green spire 
of St. Margaret
's Church. This
 is good, I lik
e it. But I can
not get on with
 the people. My
 mother is the 
only one who as
ks no questions
. Not so my fat
her. He wants m
e to tell him a
bout the front;
 he is curious 
in a way that I
 find stupid an
d distressing; 
I no longer hav
e any real cont
act with him. T
here is nothing
 he likes more 
than just heari
ng about it. I 
realize he does
 not know that 
a man cannot ta
lk of such thin
gs; I would do 
it willingly, b
ut it is too da
ngerous for me 
to put these th
ings into words
. I am afraid t
hey might then 
become gigantic
 and I be no lo
nger able to ma
ster them. What
 would become o
f us if everyth
ing that happen
s out there wer
e quite clear t
o us? So I conf
ine myself to t
elling him a fe
w amusing thing
s. But he wants
 to know whethe
r I have ever h
ad a hand-to-ha
nd fight. I say
 "No," and get 
up and go out. 
But that does n
ot mend matters
. After I have 
been startled a
 couple of time
s in the street
 by the screami
ng of the tramc
ars, which rese
mbles the shrie
k of a shell co
ming straight f
or one, somebod
y taps me on th
e shoulder. It 
is my German-ma
ster, and he fa
stens on me wit
h the usual que
stion: "Well, h
ow are things o
ut there? Terri
ble, terrible, 
eh? Yes, it is 
dreadful, but w
e must carry on
. And after all
, you do at lea
st get decent f
ood out there, 
so I hear. You 
look well, Paul
, and fit. Natu
rally it's wors
e here. Natural
ly. The best fo
r our soldiers 
every time, tha
t goes without 
saying." He dra
gs me along to 
a table with a 
lot of others. 
They welcome me
, a head-master
 shakes hands w
ith me and says
: "So you come 
from the front?
 What is the sp
irit like out t
here? Excellent
, eh? excellent
?" I explain th
at no one would
 be sorry to be
 back home. He 
laughs uproario
usly. "I can we
ll believe it! 
But first you h
ave to give the
 Froggies a goo
d hiding. Do yo
u smoke? Here, 
try one. Waiter
, bring a beer 
as well for our
 young warrior.
" Unfortunately
 I have accepte
d the cigar, so
 I have to rema
in. And they ar
e all so drippi
ng with good wi
ll that it is i
mpossible to ob
ject. All the s
ame I feel anno
yed and smoke l
ike a chimney a
s hard as I can
. In order to m
ake at least so
me show of appr
eciation I toss
 off the beer i
n one gulp. Imm
ediately a seco
nd is ordered; 
people know how
 much they are 
indebted to the
 soldiers. They
 argue about wh
at we ought to 
annex. The head
-master with th
e steel watch-c
hain wants to h
ave at least th
e whole of Belg
ium, the coal-a
reas of France,
 and a slice of
 Russia. He pro
duces reasons w
hy we must have
 them and is qu
ite inflexible 
until at last t
he others give 
in to him. Then
 he begins to e
xpound just whe
reabouts in Fra
nce the break-t
hrough must com
e, and turns to
 me: "Now, shov
e ahead a bit o
ut there with y
our everlasting
 trench warfare
--Smash through
 the johnnies a
nd then there w
ill be peace." 
I reply that in
 our opinion a 
break-through m
ay not be possi
ble. The enemy 
may have too ma
ny reserves. Be
sides, the war 
may be rather d
ifferent from w
hat people thin
k. He dismisses
 the idea lofti
ly and informs 
me I know nothi
ng about it. "T
he details, yes
," says he, "bu
t this relates 
to the whole. A
nd of that you 
are not able to
 judge. You see
 only your litt
le sector and s
o cannot have a
ny general surv
ey. You do your
 duty, you risk
 your lives, th
at deserves the
 highest honour
--every man of 
you ought to ha
ve the Iron Cro
ss--but first o
f all the enemy
 line must be b
roken through i
n Flanders and 
then rolled up 
from the top." 
He blows his no
se and wipes hi
s beard. "Compl
etely rolled up
 they must be, 
from the top to
 the bottom. An
d then to Paris
." I would like
 to know just h
ow he pictures 
it to himself, 
and pour the th
ird glass of be
er into me. Imm
ediately he ord
ers another. Bu
t I break away.
 He stuffs a fe
w more cigars i
nto my pocket a
nd sends me off
 with a friendl
y slap. "All of
 the best! I ho
pe we will soon
 hear something
 worth while fr
om you." * * I 
imagined leave 
would be differ
ent from this. 
Indeed, it was 
different a yea
r ago. It is I 
of course that 
have changed in
 the interval. 
There lies a gu
lf between that
 time and to-da
y. At that time
 I still knew n
othing about th
e war, we had b
een only in qui
et sectors. But
 now I see that
 I have been cr
ushed without k
nowing it. I fi
nd I do not bel
ong here any mo
re, it is a for
eign world. Som
e of these peop
le ask question
s, some ask no 
questions, but 
one can see tha
t they are quit
e confident the
y know all abou
t it; they ofte
n say so with t
heir air of com
prehension, so 
there is no poi
nt in discussin
g it. They make
 up a picture o
f it for themse
lves. I prefer 
to be alone, so
 that no one tr
oubles me. For 
they all come b
ack to the same
 thing, how bad
ly it goes and 
how well it goe
s; one thinks i
t is this way, 
another that; a
nd yet they are
 always absorbe
d in the things
 that go to mak
e up their own 
existence. Form
erly I lived in
 just the same 
way myself, but
 now I feel no 
contact here an
y longer. They 
talk to me too 
much. They have
 worries, aims,
 desires, that 
I can not compr
ehend. I often 
sit with one of
 them in the li
ttle beer-garde
n and try to ex
plain to him th
at this is real
ly the only thi
ng: just to sit
 quietly, like 
this. They unde
rstand of cours
e, they agree, 
they may even f
eel it so too, 
but only with w
ords, only with
 words, yes, th
at is it--they 
feel it, but al
ways with only 
half of themsel
ves, the rest o
f their being i
s taken up with
 other things, 
they are so div
ided in themsel
ves that none f
eels it with hi
s whole essence
; I cannot even
 say myself exa
ctly what I mea
n. When I see t
hem here, in th
eir rooms, in t
heir offices, a
bout their occu
pations, I feel
 an irresistibl
e attraction in
 it, I would li
ke to be here t
oo and forget t
he war; but als
o it repels me,
 it is so narro
w, how can that
 fill a man's l
ife, he ought t
o smash it to b
its; how can th
ey do it, while
 out at the fro
nt the splinter
s are whining o
ver the shell-h
oles and the st
ar-shells go up
, the wounded a
re carried back
 on water-proof
 sheets and com
rades crouch in
 the trenches.-
- They are diff
erent men here,
 men I cannot p
roperly underst
and, whom I env
y and despise. 
I must think of
 Kat and Albert
 and Müller and
 Tjaden, what w
ill they be doi
ng? No doubt th
ey are sitting 
in the canteen,
 or perhaps swi
mming--soon the
y will have to 
go up to the fr
ont-line again.
 * * In my room
 behind the tab
le stands a bro
wn leather sofa
. I sit down on
 it. On the wal
ls are pasted c
ountless pictur
es that I once 
used to cut out
 of the newspap
ers. In between
 are drawings a
nd postcards th
at have come my
 way. In the co
rner is a small
 iron stove. Ag
ainst the wall 
opposite stand 
the book-shelve
s with my books
. I used to liv
e in this room 
before I was a 
soldier. The bo
oks I bought gr
adually with th
e money I earne
d by coaching. 
Many of them ar
e second-hand, 
all the classic
s for example, 
one volume in b
lue cloth board
s cost one mark
 twenty pfennig
. I bought them
 complete becau
se I was thorou
ghgoing, I did 
not trust the e
ditors of selec
tions, even tho
ugh they may ha
ve chosen all t
he best. So I p
urchased only "
collected works
." I read most 
of them with la
udable zeal, bu
t few of them r
eally appealed 
to me. I prefer
red the other b
ooks, the moder
ns, which were 
of course much 
dearer. A few I
 came by not qu
ite honestly, I
 borrowed and d
id not return t
hem because I d
id not want to 
part with them.
 One shelf is f
illed with scho
ol books. They 
are not so well
 cared for, the
y are badly thu
mbed, and pages
 have been torn
 out for certai
n purposes. The
n below are per
iodicals, paper
s, and letters 
all jammed in t
ogether with dr
awings and roug
h sketches. I w
ant to think my
self back into 
that time. It i
s still in the 
room, I feel it
 at once, the w
alls have prese
rved it. My han
ds rest on the 
arms of the sof
a; now I make m
yself at home a
nd draw up my l
egs so that I s
it comfortably 
in the corner, 
in the arms of 
the sofa. The l
ittle window is
 open, through 
it I see the fa
miliar picture 
of the street w
ith the rising 
spire of the ch
urch at the end
. There are a c
ouple of flower
s on the table.
 Pen-holders, a
 shell as a pap
er-weight, the 
ink-well--here 
nothing is chan
ged. It will be
 like this too,
 if I am lucky,
 when the war i
s over and I co
me back here fo
r good. I will 
sit here just l
ike this and lo
ok at my room a
nd wait. I feel
 excited; but I
 do not want to
 be, for that i
s not right. I 
want that quiet
 rapture again.
 I want to feel
 the same power
ful, nameless u
rge that I used
 to feel when I
 turned to my b
ooks. The breat
h of desire tha
t then arose fr
om the coloured
 backs of the b
ooks, shall fil
l me again, mel
t the heavy, de
ad lump of lead
 that lies some
where in me and
 waken again th
e impatience of
 the future, th
e quick joy in 
the world of th
ought, it shall
 bring back aga
in the lost eag
erness of my yo
uth. I sit and 
wait. It occurs
 to me that I m
ust go and see 
Kemmerich's mot
her;--I might v
isit Mittelstae
dt too, he shou
ld be at the ba
rracks. I look 
out of the wind
ow;--beyond the
 sober picture 
of the street a
ppears a range 
of hills, dista
nt and light; i
t changes to a 
clear day in au
tumn, and I sit
 by the fire wi
th Kat and Albe
rt and eat pota
toes baked in t
heir skins. But
 I do not want 
to think of tha
t, I sweep it a
way. The room s
hall speak, it 
must catch me u
p and hold me, 
I want to feel 
that I belong h
ere, I want to 
hearken and kno
w when I go bac
k to the front 
that the war wi
ll sink down, b
e drowned utter
ly in the great
 home-coming ti
de, know that i
t will then be 
past for ever, 
and not gnaw us
 continually, t
hat it will hav
e none but an o
utward power ov
er us. The back
s of the books 
stand in rows. 
I know them all
 still, I remem
ber arranging t
hem in order. I
 implore them w
ith my eyes: Sp
eak to me--take
 me up--take me
, Life of my Yo
uth--you who ar
e care-free, be
autiful--receiv
e me again-- I 
wait, I wait. I
mages float thr
ough my mind, b
ut they do not 
grip me, they a
re mere shadows
 and memories. 
Nothing--nothin
g-- My disquiet
ude grows. A te
rrible feeling 
of foreignness 
suddenly rises 
up in me. I can
not find my way
 back, I am shu
t out though I 
entreat earnest
ly and put fort
h all my streng
th. Nothing sti
rs; listless an
d wretched, lik
e a condemned m
an, I sit there
 and the past w
ithdraws itself
. And at the sa
me time I fear 
to importune it
 too much, beca
use I do not kn
ow what might h
appen then. I a
m a soldier, I 
must cling to t
hat. Wearily I 
stand up and lo
ok out of the w
indow. Then I t
ake one of the 
books, intendin
g to read, and 
turn over the l
eaves. But I pu
t it away and t
ake out another
. There are pas
sages in it tha
t have been mar
ked. I look, tu
rn over the pag
es, take up fre
sh books. Alrea
dy they are pil
ed up beside me
. Speedily more
 join the heap,
 papers, magazi
nes, letters. I
 stand there du
mb. As before a
 judge. Dejecte
d. Words, Words
, Words--they d
o not reach me.
 Slowly I place
 the books back
 in the shelves
. Nevermore. Qu
ietly, I go out
 of the room. *
 * Still I do n
ot give up hope
. I do not, ind
eed, go to my r
oom any more, b
ut comfort myse
lf with the tho
ught that a few
 days are not e
nough to judge 
by. Afterwards-
-later on--ther
e is plenty of 
time for that. 
So I go over to
 see Mittelstae
dt in the barra
cks, and we sit
 in his room, t
here is an atmo
sphere about it
 that I do not 
like but with w
hich I am quite
 familiar. Mitt
elstaedt has so
me news ready f
or me that elec
trifies me on t
he spot. He tel
ls me Kantorek 
has been called
 up as a territ
orial. "Just th
ink of it," say
s he, and takes
 out a couple o
f good cigars, 
"I come back he
re from the hos
pital and bump 
right into him.
 He stretches o
ut his paw to m
e and bleats: '
Hullo Mittelsta
edt, how are yo
u?'--I look at 
him and say: 'T
erritorial Kant
orek, business 
is business and
 schnapps is sc
hnapps, you oug
ht to know that
 well enough yo
urself. Stand t
o attention whe
n you speak to 
a superior offi
cer.' You shoul
d have seen his
 face! A cross 
between a dud a
nd a pickled cu
cumber. He trie
d once again to
 chum up. So I 
snubbed him a b
it harder. Then
 he brought up 
his biggest gun
s and asked con
fidentially: 'W
ould you like m
e to use my inf
luence so that 
you can take an
 emergency-exam
.?' He was tryi
ng to remind me
 of those thing
s, you know. Th
en I got mad an
d I reminded hi
m of something 
instead. 'Terri
torial Kantorek
, two years ago
 you preached u
s into enlistin
g; and among us
 there was one,
 Joseph Behm, w
ho didn't want 
to enlist. He w
as killed three
 months before 
he would have b
een called up i
n the ordinary 
way. If it had 
not been for yo
u he would have
 lived just tha
t much longer. 
And now: Dismis
s. You will hea
r from me later
.' It was easy 
to get put in c
harge of his co
mpany. First th
ing I did was t
o take him to t
he stores and f
it him out with
 a suitable equ
ipment. You wil
l see in a minu
te." We go out 
to the parade g
round. The comp
any has fallen 
in. Mittelstaed
t stands them a
t ease and insp
ects. Then I se
e Kantorek and 
am scarcely abl
e to stifle my 
laughter. He is
 wearing a fade
d blue tunic. O
n the back and 
in the sleeves 
there are big d
ark patches. Th
e overcoat must
 have belonged 
to a giant. The
 black, worn br
eeches are just
 as much too sh
ort; they reach
 barely halfway
 down his calf.
 The boots, tou
gh old clod-hop
pers, with turn
ed-up toes and 
laces at the si
de, are much to
o big for him. 
But as a compen
sation the cap 
is too small, a
 terribly dirty
, mean little p
ill-box. The wh
ole rig-out is 
just pitiful. M
ittelstaedt sto
ps in front of 
him: "Territori
al Kantorek, do
 you call those
 buttons polish
ed? You seem as
 though you can
 never learn. I
nadequate, Kant
orek, quite ina
dequate----" It
 makes me bubbl
e with glee. In
 school Kantore
k used to chast
en Mittelstaedt
 with exactly t
he same express
ion--"Inadequat
e, Mittelstaedt
, quite inadequ
ate." Mittelsta
edt continues t
o upbraid him: 
"Look at Boettc
her now, there'
s a model for y
ou to learn fro
m." I can hardl
y believe my ey
es. Boettcher i
s there too, Bo
ettcher, our sc
hool porter. An
d he is a model
! Kantorek shoo
ts a glance at 
me as if he wou
ld like to eat 
me. But I grin 
at him innocent
ly, as though I
 do not recogni
ze him any more
. Nothing could
 look more ludi
crous than his 
forage-cap and 
his uniform. An
d this is the o
bject before wh
om we used to s
tand in anguish
, as he sat up 
there enthroned
 at his desk, s
pearing at us w
ith his pencil 
for our mistake
s in those irre
gular French ve
rbs with which 
afterwards we m
ade so little h
eadway in Franc
e. That is bare
ly two years ag
o--and now here
 stands Territo
rial Kantorek, 
the spell quite
 broken, with b
ent knees, arms
 like pothooks,
 unpolished but
tons and that l
udicrous rig-ou
t--an impossibl
e soldier. I ca
nnot reconcile 
this with the m
enacing figure 
at the schoolma
ster's desk. I 
wonder what I, 
the old soldier
, would do if t
his skin full o
f woe ever dare
d to say to me 
again: "Bäumer,
 give the imper
fect of 'aller.
'" Then Mittels
taedt makes the
m practice skir
mishing, and as
 a favour appoi
nts Kantorek sq
uad leader. Now
 in skirmishing
 the squad lead
er has always t
o keep twenty p
aces in front o
f his squad; if
 the order come
s "On the march
, about turn," 
the line of ski
rmishers simply
 turns about, b
ut the squad le
ader, who now f
inds himself su
ddenly twenty p
aces in rear of
 the line, has 
to rush up at t
he double and t
ake his positio
n again twenty 
paces in front 
of the squad. T
hat makes altog
ether forty pac
es double-march
. But no sooner
 has he arrived
 than the order
 "On the march,
 about turn," c
omes again and 
he once more ha
s to race at to
p speed another
 forty paces to
 the other side
. In this way t
he squad has ma
de merely the t
urn-about and a
 couple of pace
s while the squ
ad-leader dashe
s backwards and
 forwards like 
a fart on a cur
tain pole. That
 is one of Himm
elstoss' well-w
orn recipes. Ka
ntorek can hard
ly expect anyth
ing else from M
ittelstaedt, fo
r he once messe
d up the latter
's chance of pr
omotion, and Mi
ttelstaedt woul
d be a big fool
 not to make th
e best of such 
a good opportun
ity as this, be
fore he goes ba
ck to the front
 again. A man m
ight well die e
asier after the
 army has given
 him just one s
uch stroke of l
uck. In the mea
ntime Kantorek 
is dashing up a
nd down like a 
wild-boar. Afte
r a while Mitte
lstaedt stops t
he skirmish and
 begins the ver
y important exe
rcise of creepi
ng. On hands an
d knees, carryi
ng his gun in r
egulation fashi
on, Kantorek sh
oves his absurd
 figure over th
e sand immediat
ely in front of
 us. He is brea
thing hard, and
 his panting is
 music. Mittels
taedt encourage
s Kantorek the 
Territorial wit
h quotations fr
om Kantorek the
 school-master.
 "Territorial K
antorek, we hav
e the good fort
une to live in 
a great age, we
 must all humbl
e ourselves and
 for once put a
side bitterness
." Kantorek swe
ats and spits o
ut a dirty piec
e of wood that 
has lodged in h
is teeth. Mitte
lstaedt stoops 
down and says r
eproachfully: "
And in the trif
les never lose 
sight of the gr
eat adventure, 
Territorial Kan
torek!" It amaz
es me that Kant
orek does not e
xplode with a b
ang, especially
 when, during p
hysical exercis
es, Mittelstaed
t copies him to
 perfection, se
izing him by th
e seat of his t
rousers as he i
s climbing alon
g the horizonta
l bar, so that 
he can just rai
se his chin abo
ve the beam, an
d then starts t
o give him good
 advice. That i
s exactly what 
Kantorek used t
o do to him at 
school. The ext
ra fatigues are
 next detailed 
off. "Kantorek 
and Boettcher, 
bread fatigue! 
Take the handca
rt with you." I
n a couple of m
inutes the two 
set off togethe
r pushing the b
arrow. Kantorek
 in a fury walk
s with his head
 down. But the 
porter is delig
hted to have sc
ored light duty
. The bakehouse
 is away at the
 other end of t
he town, and th
e two must go t
here and back t
hrough the whol
e length of it.
 "They've done 
that a couple o
f times already
," grins Mittel
staedt. "There 
are still a few
 people waiting
 to see them." 
"Excellent," I 
say, "but hasn'
t he reported y
ou yet?" "He di
d try. Our C.O.
 laughed like t
he deuce when h
e heard the sto
ry. He hasn't a
ny time for sch
oolmasters. Bes
ides, I'm sweet
 with his daugh
ter." "He'll me
ss up the exami
nation for you.
" "I don't care
," says Mittels
taedt calmly. "
Besides, his co
mplaint came to
 nothing becaus
e I could show 
that he had had
 hardly anythin
g but light dut
y." "Couldn't y
ou polish him u
p a bit?" I ask
. "He's too stu
pid, I couldn't
 be bothered," 
answers Mittels
taedt contemptu
ously. * * What
 is leave?--A p
ause that only 
makes everythin
g after it so m
uch worse. Alre
ady the sense o
f parting begin
s to intrude it
self. My mother
 watches me sil
ently,--I know 
she counts the 
days;--every mo
rning she is sa
d. It is one da
y less. She has
 put away my pa
ck, she does no
t want to be re
minded by it. T
he hours pass q
uickly if a man
 broods. I pull
 myself togethe
r, and go with 
my sister to th
e butcher's to 
get a pound of 
bones. That is 
a great luxury 
and people line
 up early in th
e morning and s
tand waiting. M
any of them fai
nt. We have no 
luck. After wai
ting by turns f
or three hours 
the queue dispe
rses. The bones
 have not laste
d out. It is a 
good thing I ge
t my rations. I
 bring them to 
my mother and i
n that way we a
ll get somethin
g decent to eat
. The days grow
 ever more stra
ined and my mot
her's eyes more
 sorrowful. Fou
r days left now
. I must go and
 see Kemmerich'
s mother. * * I
 cannot write t
hat down. This 
quaking, sobbin
g woman who sha
kes me and crie
s out on me: "W
hy are you livi
ng then, when h
e is dead?"--wh
o drowns me in 
tears and calls
 out: "What are
 you there for 
at all, child, 
when you----"--
who drops into 
a chair and wai
ls: "Did you se
e him? Did you 
see him then? H
ow did he die?"
 I tell her he 
was shot throug
h the heart and
 died instantan
eously. She loo
ks at me, she d
oubts me: "You 
lie. I know bet
ter. I have fel
t how terribly 
he died. I have
 heard his voic
e at night, I h
ave felt his an
guish--tell the
 truth, I want 
to know it, I m
ust know it." "
No," I say, "I 
was beside him.
 He died at onc
e." She pleads 
with me gently:
 "Tell me. You 
must tell me. I
 know you want 
to comfort me, 
but don't you s
ee, you torment
 me far more th
an if you told 
me the truth? I
 cannot bear th
e uncertainty. 
Tell me how it 
was and even th
ough it will be
 terrible, it w
ill be far bett
er than what I 
have to think i
f you don't." I
 will never tel
l her, she can 
make mincemeat 
out of me first
. I console her
, but she strik
es me as rather
 stupid all the
 same. Why does
n't she stop wo
rrying? Kemmeri
ch will stay de
ad whether she 
knows about it 
or not. When a 
man has seen so
 many dead he c
annot understan
d any longer wh
y there should 
be so much angu
ish over a sing
le individual. 
So I say rather
 impatiently: "
He died immedia
tely. He felt a
bsolutely nothi
ng at all. His 
face was quite 
calm." She is s
ilent. Then she
 says slowly: "
Will you swear 
it?" "Yes." "By
 everything tha
t is sacred to 
you?" Good God,
 what is there 
that is sacred 
to me?--such th
ings change pre
tty quickly wit
h us. "Yes, he 
died at once." 
"Are you willin
g never to come
 back yourself,
 if it isn't tr
ue?" "May I nev
er come back if
 he wasn't kill
ed instantaneou
sly." I would s
wear to anythin
g. But she seem
s to believe me
. She moans and
 weeps steadily
. I have to tel
l how it happen
ed so I invent 
a story and I a
lmost believe i
t myself. As I 
leave she kisse
s me and gives 
me a picture of
 him. In his re
cruit's uniform
 he leans on a 
round rustic ta
ble with legs m
ade of birch br
anches. Behind 
him a wood is p
ainted on a cur
tain, and on th
e table stands 
a mug of beer. 
* * It is the l
ast evening at 
home. Everyone 
is silent. I go
 to bed early, 
I seize the pil
low, press it a
gainst myself a
nd bury my head
 in it. Who kno
ws if I will ev
er lie in a fea
ther bed again?
 Late in the ni
ght my mother c
omes into my ro
om. She thinks 
I am asleep, an
d I pretend to 
be so. To talk,
 to stay awake 
with one anothe
r, it is too ha
rd. She sits lo
ng into the nig
ht although she
 is in pain and
 often writhes.
 At last I can 
bear it no long
er, and pretend
 I have just wa
kened up. "Go a
nd sleep, mothe
r, you will cat
ch cold here." 
"I can sleep en
ough later," sh
e says. I sit u
p. "I don't go 
straight back t
o the front, mo
ther. I have to
 do four weeks 
at the training
 camp. I may co
me over from th
ere one Sunday,
 perhaps." She 
is silent. Then
 she asks gentl
y: "Are you ver
y much afraid?"
 "No, mother." 
"I would like t
o tell you to b
e on your guard
 against the wo
men out in Fran
ce. They are no
 good." Ah! Mot
her, Mother! Yo
u still think I
 am a child--wh
y can I not put
 my head in you
r lap and weep?
 Why have I alw
ays to be stron
g and self-cont
rolled? I would
 like to weep a
nd be comforted
, too, indeed I
 am little more
 than a child; 
in the wardrobe
 still hang my 
short, boy's tr
ousers--it is s
uch a little ti
me ago, why is 
it over? "Where
 we are there a
ren't any women
, mother," I sa
y as calmly as 
I can. "And be 
very careful at
 the front, Pau
l." Ah, Mother,
 Mother! Why do
 I not take you
 in my arms and
 die with you. 
What poor wretc
hes we are! "Ye
s, mother, I wi
ll." "I will pr
ay for you ever
y day, Paul." A
h! Mother, Moth
er! Let us rise
 up and go out,
 back through t
he years, where
 the burden of 
all this misery
 lies on us no 
more, back to y
ou and me alone
, Mother! "Perh
aps you can get
 a job that is 
not so dangerou
s." "Yes, mothe
r, perhaps I ca
n get into the 
cook-house, tha
t can easily be
 done." "You do
 it then, and i
f the others sa
y anything----"
 "That won't wo
rry me, mother-
---" She sighs.
 Her face is a 
white gleam in 
the darkness. "
Now you must go
 to sleep, moth
er." She does n
ot reply. I get
 up and wrap my
 cover round he
r shoulders. Sh
e supports hers
elf on my arm, 
she is in pain.
 And so I take 
her to her room
. I stay with h
er a little whi
le. "And you mu
st get well aga
in, mother, bef
ore I come back
." "Yes, yes, m
y child." "You 
ought not to se
nd your things 
to me, mother. 
We have plenty 
to eat out ther
e. You can make
 much better us
e of them here.
" How destitute
 she lies there
 in her bed, sh
e, that loves m
e more than all
 the world. As 
I am about to l
eave, she says 
hastily: "I hav
e two pairs of 
under-pants for
 you. They are 
all wool. They 
will keep you w
arm. You must n
ot forget to pu
t them in your 
pack." Ah! Moth
er! I know what
 these underpan
ts have cost yo
u in waiting, a
nd walking, and
 begging! Ah! M
other, Mother! 
how can it be t
hat I must part
 from you? Who 
else is there t
hat has any cla
im on me but yo
u. Here I sit a
nd there you ar
e lying, and we
 have so much t
o say, that we 
could never say
 it. "Good-nigh
t, mother." "Go
od-night, my ch
ild." The room 
is dark. I hear
 my mother's br
eathing, and th
e ticking of th
e clock. Outsid
e the window th
e wind blows an
d the chestnut 
trees rustle. O
n the landing I
 stumble over m
y pack which li
es there alread
y made up, beca
use I have to l
eave early in t
he morning. I b
ite into my pil
low. I grasp th
e iron rods of 
my bed with my 
fists. I ought 
never to have c
ome here. Out t
here I was indi
fferent and oft
en hopeless;--I
 will never be 
able to be so a
gain. I was a s
oldier, and now
 I am nothing b
ut an agony for
 myself, for my
 mother, for ev
erything that i
s so comfortles
s and without e
nd. I ought nev
er to have come
 on leave. CHAP
TER VIII I alre
ady know the ca
mp on the moors
. It was here t
hat Himmelstoss
 gave Tjaden hi
s education. Bu
t now I know ha
rdly anyone her
e; as ever, all
 is altered. Th
ere are only a 
few people that
 I have occasio
nally met befor
e. I go through
 the routine me
chanically. In 
the evenings I 
generally go to
 the Soldiers' 
Home, where the
 newspapers are
 laid out, but 
which I do not 
read; still, th
ere is a piano 
there that I am
 glad enough to
 play on. Two g
irls are in att
endance, one of
 them is young.
 The camp is su
rrounded with h
igh barbed-wire
 fences. If we 
come back late 
from the Soldie
rs' Home we hav
e to show passe
s. But those wh
o are on good t
erms with the g
uard can get th
rough, of cours
e. Between the 
junipers and th
e birch trees o
n the moor we p
ractice company
-drill each day
. It is bearabl
e if one expect
s nothing bette
r. We advance a
t a run, fling 
ourselves down,
 and our pantin
g breath moves 
the stalks of t
he grasses and 
the flowers of 
the heather to 
and fro. Looked
 at so closely 
one sees the fi
ne sand is comp
osed of million
s of the tinies
t pebbles as cl
ear as if they 
had been made i
n a laboratory 
It is strangely
 inviting to di
g one's hands i
nto it. But mos
t beautiful are
 the woods with
 their line of 
birch trees. Th
eir colour chan
ges with every 
minute. Now the
 stems gleam pu
rest white, and
 between them a
iry and silken,
 hangs the past
el-green of the
 leaves; the ne
xt moment all c
hanges to an op
alescent blue, 
as the shiverin
g breezes pass 
down from the h
eights and touc
h the green lig
htly away; and 
again in one pl
ace it deepens 
almost to black
 as a cloud pas
ses over the su
n. And this sha
dow moves like 
a ghost through
 the dim trunks
 and passes far
 out over the m
oor to the sky-
-then the birch
es stand out ag
ain like gay ba
nners on white 
poles, with the
ir red and gold
 patches of aut
umn-tinted leav
es. I often bec
ome so lost in 
the play of sof
t light and tra
nsparent shadow
, that I almost
 fail to hear t
he commands. It
 is when one is
 alone that one
 begins to obse
rve Nature and 
to love her. An
d here I have n
ot much compani
onship, and do 
not even desire
 it. We are too
 little acquain
ted with one an
other to do mor
e than joke a b
it and play pok
er or nap in th
e evenings. Alo
ngside our camp
 is the big Rus
sian prison cam
p. It is separa
ted from us by 
a wire fence, b
ut in spite of 
this the prison
ers come across
 to us. They se
em nervous and 
fearful, though
 most of them a
re big fellows 
with beards--th
ey look like me
ek, scolded, St
. Bernard dogs.
 They slink abo
ut our camp and
 pick over the 
garbage tins. O
ne can imagine 
what they find 
there. With us 
food is pretty 
scarce and none
 too good at th
at--turnips cut
 into six piece
s and boiled in
 water, and unw
ashed carrot to
ps;--mouldy pot
atoes are tit-b
its, and the ch
ief luxury is a
 thin rice soup
 in which float
 little bits of
 beef-sinew, bu
t these are cut
 up so small th
at they take a 
lot of finding.
 Everything get
s eaten, notwit
hstanding, and 
if ever anyone 
is so well off 
as not to want 
all his share, 
there are a doz
en others stand
ing by ready to
 relieve him of
 it. Only the d
regs that the l
adle cannot rea
ch are tipped o
ut and thrown i
nto the garbage
 tins. Along wi
th that sometim
es go a few tur
nip peelings, m
ouldy bread cru
sts and all kin
ds of muck. Thi
s thin, miserab
le, dirty garba
ge is the objec
tive of the pri
soners. They pi
ck it out of th
e stinking tins
 greedily and g
o off with it u
nder their blou
ses. It is stra
nge to see thes
e enemies of ou
rs so close up.
 They have face
s that make one
 think--honest 
peasant faces, 
broad foreheads
, broad noses, 
broad mouths, b
road hands, and
 thick hair. Th
ey ought to be 
put to threshin
g, reaping, and
 apple picking.
 They look just
 as kindly as o
ur own peasants
 in Friesland. 
It is distressi
ng to watch the
ir movements, t
o see them begg
ing for somethi
ng to eat. They
 are all rather
 feeble, for th
ey only get eno
ugh nourishment
 to keep them f
rom starving. O
urselves we hav
e not had suffi
cient to eat fo
r long enough. 
They have dysen
tery; furtively
 many of them d
isplay the bloo
d-stained tails
 of their shirt
s. Their backs,
 their necks ar
e bent, their k
nees sag, their
 heads droop as
 they stretch o
ut their hands 
and beg in the 
few words of Ge
rman that they 
know--beg with 
those soft, dee
p, musical voic
es, that are li
ke warm stoves 
and cosy rooms 
at home. Some m
en there are wh
o give them a k
ick, so that th
ey fall over;--
but those are n
ot many. The ma
jority do nothi
ng to them, jus
t ignore them. 
Occasionally, w
hen they are to
o grovelling, i
t makes a man m
ad and then he 
kicks them. If 
only they would
 not look at on
e so-- What gre
at misery can b
e in two such s
mall spots, no 
bigger than a m
an's thumb--in 
their eyes! The
y come over to 
the camp in the
 evenings and t
rade. They exch
ange whatever t
hey possess for
 bread. Often t
hey have fair s
uccess, because
 they have very
 good boots and
 ours are bad. 
The leather of 
their knee boot
s is wonderfull
y soft, like su
ede. The peasan
ts among us who
 get tit bits s
ent from home c
an afford to tr
ade. The price 
of a pair of bo
ots is about tw
o or three loav
es of army brea
d, or a loaf of
 bread and a sm
all, tough ham 
sausage. But mo
st of the Russi
ans have long s
ince parted wit
h whatever thin
gs they had. No
w they wear onl
y the most piti
ful clothing, a
nd try to excha
nge little carv
ings and object
s that they hav
e made out of s
hell fragments 
and copper driv
ing bands. Of c
ourse, they don
't get much for
 such things, t
hough they may 
have taken imme
nse pains with 
them--they go f
or a slice or t
wo of bread. Ou
r peasants are 
hard and cunnin
g when they bar
gain. They hold
 the piece of b
read or sausage
 right under th
e nose of the R
ussian till he 
grows pale with
 greed and his 
eyes bulge and 
then he will gi
ve anything for
 it. The peasan
ts wrap up thei
r booty with th
e utmost solemn
ity, and then g
et out their bi
g pocket knives
, and slowly an
d deliberately 
cut off a slice
 of bread for t
hemselves from 
their supply an
d with every mo
uthful take a p
iece of the goo
d, tough sausag
e and so reward
 themselves wit
h a good feed. 
It is distressi
ng to watch the
m take their af
ternoon meal th
us; one would l
ike to crack th
em over their t
hick pates. The
y rarely give a
nything away. H
ow little we un
derstand one an
other! * * I am
 often on guard
 over the Russi
ans. In the dar
kness one sees 
their forms mov
e like sick sto
rks, like great
 birds. They co
me close up to 
the wire fence 
and lean their 
faces against i
t; their finger
s hook round th
e mesh. Often m
any stand side 
by side, and br
eathe the wind 
that comes down
 from the moors
 and the forest
. They rarely s
peak and then o
nly a few words
. They are more
 human and more
 brotherly towa
rds one another
, it seems to m
e, than we are.
 But perhaps th
at is merely be
cause they feel
 themselves to 
be more unfortu
nate than us. A
nyway the war i
s over so far a
s they are conc
erned. But to w
ait for dysente
ry is not much 
of a life eithe
r. The Territor
ials who are in
 charge of them
 say that they 
were much more 
lively at first
. They used to 
have intrigues 
among themselve
s, as always ha
ppens, and it w
ould often come
 to blows and k
nives. But now 
they are quite 
apathetic, and 
listless; most 
of them do not 
masturbate any 
more, they are 
so feeble, thou
gh occasionally
 it is so bad t
hat they do it 
barracks fashio
n. They stand a
t the wire fenc
e; sometimes on
e goes away and
 then another a
t once takes hi
s place in the 
line. Most of t
hem are silent;
 occasionally o
ne begs a cigar
ette butt. I se
e their dark fo
rms, their bear
ds move in the 
wind. I know no
thing of them e
xcept that they
 are prisoners,
 and that is ex
actly what trou
bles me. Their 
life is obscure
 and guiltless;
--if I could kn
ow more of them
, what their na
mes are, how th
ey live, what t
hey are waiting
 for, what are 
their burdens, 
then my emotion
 would have an 
object and migh
t become sympat
hy. But as it i
s I perceive be
hind them only 
the suffering o
f the creature,
 the awful mela
ncholy of life 
and the pitiles
sness of men. A
 word of comman
d has made thes
e silent figure
s our enemies; 
a word of comma
nd might transf
orm them into o
ur friends. At 
some table a do
cument is signe
d by some perso
ns whom none of
 us knows, and 
then for years 
together that v
ery crime on wh
ich formerly th
e world's conde
mnation and sev
erest penalty f
ell, becomes ou
r highest aim. 
But who can dra
w such a distin
ction when he l
ooks at these q
uiet men with t
heir childlike 
faces and apost
les' beards. An
y non-commissio
ned officer is 
more of an enem
y to a recruit,
 any schoolmast
er to a pupil t
han they are to
 us. And yet we
 would shoot at
 them again and
 they at us if 
they were free.
 I am frightene
d: I dare think
 this way no mo
re. This way li
es the abyss. I
t is not now th
e time; but I w
ill not lose th
ese thoughts, I
 will keep them
, shut them awa
y until the war
 is ended. My h
eart beats fast
: this is the a
im, the great, 
the sole aim, t
hat I have thou
ght of in the t
renches; that I
 have looked fo
r as the only p
ossibility of e
xistence after 
this annihilati
on of all human
 feeling; this 
is a task that 
will make life 
afterward worth
y of these hide
ous years. I ta
ke out my cigar
ettes, break ea
ch one in half 
and give them t
o the Russians.
 They bow to me
 and then they 
light the cigar
ettes. Now red 
points glow in 
every face. The
y comfort me; i
t looks as thou
gh there were l
ittle windows i
n dark village 
cottages saying
 that behind th
em are rooms fu
ll of peace. * 
* The days go b
y. On a foggy m
orning another 
of the Russians
 is buried; alm
ost every day o
ne of them dies
. I am on guard
 during the bur
ial. The prison
ers sing a chor
ale, they sing 
in parts, and i
t sounds almost
 as if there we
re no voices, b
ut an organ far
 away on the mo
or. The burial 
is quickly over
. In the evenin
g they stand ag
ain at the wire
 fence and the 
wind comes down
 to them from t
he beech woods.
 The stars are 
cold. I now kno
w a few of thos
e who speak a l
ittle German. T
here is a music
ian amongst the
m, he says he u
sed to be a vio
linist in Berli
n. When he hear
s that I can pl
ay the piano he
 fetches his vi
olin and plays.
 The others sit
 down and lean 
their backs aga
inst the fence.
 He stands up a
nd plays, somet
imes he has tha
t absent expres
sion which viol
inists get when
 they close the
ir eyes; or aga
in he sways the
 instrument to 
the rhythm and 
smiles across t
o me. He plays 
mostly folk son
gs and the othe
rs hum with him
. They are like
 a country of d
ark hills that 
sing far down u
nder the ground
. The sound of 
the violin stan
ds like a slend
er girl above i
t and is clear 
and alone. The 
voices cease an
d the violin co
ntinues alone. 
In the night it
 is so thin it 
sounds frozen; 
one must stand 
close up; it wo
uld be much bet
ter in a room;-
-out here it ma
kes a man grow 
sad. * * Becaus
e I have alread
y had a long le
ave I get none 
on Sundays. So 
the last Sunday
 before I go ba
ck to the front
 my father and 
eldest sister c
ome over to see
 me. All day we
 sit in the Sol
diers' Home. Wh
ere else could 
we go, we don't
 want to stay i
n the camp. Abo
ut midday we go
 for a walk on 
the moors. The 
hours are a tor
ture; we do not
 know what to t
alk about, so w
e speak of my m
other's illness
. It is now def
initely cancer,
 she is already
 in the hospita
l and will be o
perated on shor
tly. The doctor
s hope she will
 recover, but w
e have never he
ard of cancer b
eing cured. "Wh
ere is she then
?" I ask. "In t
he Luisa Hospit
al," says my fa
ther. "In which
 class?" "Third
. We must wait 
till we know wh
at the operatio
n costs. She wa
nted to be in t
he third hersel
f. She said tha
t then she woul
d have some com
pany. And besid
es it is cheape
r." "So she is 
lying there wit
h all those peo
ple. If only sh
e could sleep p
roperly." My fa
ther nods. His 
face is broken 
and full of fur
rows. My mother
 has always bee
n sickly; and t
hough she has o
nly gone to the
 hospital when 
she has been co
mpelled to, it 
has cost a grea
t deal of money
, and my father
's life has bee
n practically g
iven up to it. 
"If only I knew
 how much the o
peration costs,
" says he. "Hav
e you not asked
?" "Not directl
y, I cannot do 
that--the surge
on might take i
t amiss and tha
t would not do,
 he must operat
e on mother." Y
es, I think bit
terly, that's h
ow it is with u
s, and with all
 poor people. T
hey don't dare 
to ask the pric
e, but worry th
emselves dreadf
ully beforehand
 about it; but 
the others, for
 whom it is not
 important, the
y settle the pr
ice first as a 
matter of cours
e. And the doct
or does not tak
e it amiss from
 them. "And the
 dressings afte
rwards are so e
xpensive," says
 my father. "Do
esn't the Inval
id's Fund pay a
nything toward 
it, then?" I as
k. "Mother has 
been ill too lo
ng." "Have you 
any money at al
l?" He shakes h
is head: "No, b
ut I can do som
e overtime." I 
know. He will s
tand at his des
k folding and p
asting and cutt
ing until twelv
e o'clock at ni
ght. At eight o
'clock in the e
vening he will 
eat some of the
 miserable rubb
ish they get in
 exchange for t
heir food ticke
ts, then he wil
l take a powder
 for his headac
he and work on.
 In order to ch
eer him up a bi
t I tell him a 
few stories, so
ldiers' jokes, 
and the like, a
bout generals a
nd sergeant-maj
ors. Afterwards
 I accompany th
em both to the 
railway station
. They give me 
a pot of jam an
d a bag of pota
to-cakes that m
y mother has ma
de for me. Then
 they go off an
d I return to t
he camp. In the
 evening I spre
ad the jam on t
he cakes and ea
t some. But I h
ave no taste fo
r them. So I go
 out to give th
em to the Russi
ans. Then it oc
curs to me that
 my mother cook
ed them herself
 and that she w
as probably in 
pain as she sto
od before the h
ot stove. I put
 the bag back i
n my pack and t
ake only two ca
kes to the Russ
ians. CHAPTER I
X We travel for
 several days. 
The first aerop
lanes appear in
 the sky. We ro
ll on past tran
sport lines. Gu
ns, guns. The l
ight railway pi
cks us up. I se
arch for my reg
iment. No one k
nows exactly wh
ere it lies. So
mewhere or othe
r I put up for 
the night, some
where or other 
I receive provi
sions and a few
 vague instruct
ions. And so wi
th my pack and 
my rifle I set 
out again on th
e way. By the t
ime I come up t
hey are no long
er in that deva
stated place. I
 hear we have b
ecome one of th
e flying divisi
ons that are pu
shed in whereve
r it is hottest
. That does not
 sound cheerful
 to me. They te
ll me of heavy 
losses that we 
have been havin
g. I inquire af
ter Kat and Alb
ert. No one kno
ws anything of 
them. I search 
farther and wan
der about here 
and there; it i
s a wonderful f
eeling. One nig
ht and then ano
ther I camp out
 like a Red Ind
ian. Then at la
st I get some d
efinite informa
tion, and by th
e afternoon I a
m able to repor
t to the Orderl
y Room. The ser
geant-major det
ains me there. 
The company com
es back in two 
days' time. The
re is no object
 in sending me 
up now. "What w
as it like on l
eave?" he asks,
 "pretty good, 
eh?" "In parts,
" I say. "Yes,"
 he sighs, "yes
, if a man didn
't have to come
 away again. Th
e second half i
s always rather
 messed up by t
hat." I loaf ar
ound until the 
company comes b
ack in the earl
y morning, grey
, dirty, soured
, and gloomy. T
hen I jump up, 
push in amongst
 them, my eyes 
searching. Ther
e is Tjaden, th
ere is Müller b
lowing his nose
, and there are
 Kat and Kropp.
 We arrange our
 sacks of straw
 side by side. 
I have an uneas
y conscience wh
en I look at th
em, and yet wit
hout any good r
eason. Before w
e turn in I bri
ng out the rest
 of the potato-
cakes and jam s
o that they can
 have some too.
 The two outer 
cakes are mould
y, still it is 
possible to eat
 them. I keep t
hose for myself
 and give the f
resh ones to Ka
t and Kropp. Ka
t chews and say
s: "These are f
rom your mother
?" I nod. "Good
," says he, "I 
can tell by the
 taste." I coul
d almost weep. 
I can hardly co
ntrol myself an
y longer. But i
t will soon be 
all right again
 back here with
 Kat and Albert
. This is where
 I belong. "You
've been lucky,
" whispers Krop
p to me before 
we drop off to 
sleep, "they sa
y we are going 
to Russia." To 
Russia. It's no
t much of a war
 over there. In
 the distance t
he front thunde
rs. The walls o
f the hut rattl
e. * * There's 
a great deal of
 polishing bein
g done. We are 
inspected at ev
ery turn. Every
thing that is t
orn is exchange
d for new. I sc
ore a spotless 
new tunic out o
f it and Kat, o
f course, an en
tire outfit. A 
rumour is going
 round that the
re may be peace
, but the other
 story is more 
likely--that we
 are bound for 
Russia. Still, 
what do we need
 new things for
 in Russia? At 
last it leaks o
ut--the Kaiser 
is coming to re
view us. Hence 
all the inspect
ions. For eight
 whole days one
 would suppose 
we were in a ba
se-camp, there 
is so much dril
l and fuss. Eve
ryone is peevis
h and touchy, w
e do not take k
indly to all th
is polishing, m
uch less to par
ades. Such thin
gs exasperate a
 soldier more t
han the front-l
ine. At last th
e moment arrive
s. We stand up 
stiff and the K
aiser appears. 
We are curious 
to see what he 
looks like. He 
stalks along th
e line, and I a
m really rather
 disappointed; 
judging from hi
s pictures I im
agined him to b
e bigger and mo
re powerfully b
uilt, and above
 all to have a 
thundering voic
e. He distribut
es Iron Crosses
 and speaks to 
this man and to
 that. Then we 
march off. Afte
rwards we discu
ss it. Tjaden s
ays with astoni
shment: "So tha
t is the All-Hi
ghest! And ever
yone, bar nobod
y, has to stand
 up stiff in fr
ont of him!" He
 meditates: "Hi
ndenburg too, h
e has to stand 
up stiff to him
, eh?" "Sure," 
says Kat. Tjade
n hasn't finish
ed yet. He thin
ks for a while 
and then asks: 
"And would a ki
ng have to stan
d up stiff to a
n emperor?" Non
e of us is quit
e sure about it
, but we don't 
suppose so. The
y are both so e
xalted that sta
nding strictly 
to attention is
 probably not i
nsisted on. "Wh
at rot you do h
atch out," says
 Kat. "The main
 point is that 
you have to sta
nd stiff yourse
lf." But Tjaden
 is quite fasci
nated. His othe
rwise prosy fan
cy is blowing b
ubbles. "But lo
ok," he announc
es, "I simply c
an't believe th
at an emperor h
as to go to the
 latrine the sa
me as I have." 
"You can bet yo
ur boots on it.
" "Four and a h
alf-wit make se
ven," says Kat.
 "You've got a 
maggot in your 
brain, Tjaden, 
just you run al
ong to the latr
ine quick, and 
get your head c
lear, so that y
ou don't talk l
ike a two-year-
old." Tjaden di
sappears. "But 
what I would li
ke to know," sa
ys Albert, "is 
whether there w
ould not have b
een a war if th
e Kaiser had sa
id No." "I'm su
re of this much
," I interject,
 "he was agains
t it from the f
irst." "Well, i
f not him alone
, then perhaps 
if twenty or th
irty people in 
the world had s
aid No." "That'
s probable," I 
agree, "but the
y damned well s
aid Yes." "It's
 queer, when on
e thinks about 
it," goes on Kr
opp, "we are he
re to protect o
ur fatherland. 
And the French 
are over there 
to protect thei
r fatherland. N
ow, who's in th
e right?" "Perh
aps both," say 
I, without beli
eving it. "Yes,
 well now," pur
sues Albert, an
d I see that he
 means to drive
 me into a corn
er, "but our pr
ofessors and pa
rsons and newsp
apers say that 
we are the only
 ones that are 
right, and let'
s hope so;--but
 the French pro
fessors and par
sons and newspa
pers say that t
he right is on 
their side, now
 what about tha
t?" "That I don
't know," I say
, "but whicheve
r way it is the
re's war all th
e same and ever
y month more co
untries coming 
in." Tjaden rea
ppears. He is s
till quite exci
ted and again j
oins the conver
sation, wonderi
ng just how a w
ar gets started
. "Mostly by on
e country badly
 offending anot
her," answers A
lbert with a sl
ight air of sup
eriority. Then 
Tjaden pretends
 to be obtuse. 
"A country? I d
on't follow. A 
mountain in Ger
many cannot off
end a mountain 
in France. Or a
 river, or a wo
od, or a field 
of wheat." "Are
 you really as 
stupid as that,
 or are you jus
t pulling my le
g?" growls Krop
p, "I don't mea
n that at all. 
One people offe
nds the other--
--" "Then I hav
en't any busine
ss here at all,
" replies Tjade
n, "I don't fee
l myself offend
ed." "Well, let
 me tell you," 
says Albert sou
rly, "it doesn'
t apply to tram
ps like you." "
Then I can be g
oing home right
 away," retorts
 Tjaden, and we
 all laugh. "Ac
h, man! he mean
s the people as
 a whole, the S
tate----" excla
ims Müller. "St
ate, State"--Tj
aden snaps his 
fingers contemp
tuously, "Genda
rmes, police, t
axes, that's yo
ur State;--if t
hat's what you 
are talking abo
ut, no thank yo
u." "That's rig
ht," says Kat, 
"you've said so
mething for onc
e, Tjaden. Stat
e and home-coun
try, there's a 
big difference.
" "But they go 
together," insi
sts Kropp, "wit
hout the State 
there wouldn't 
be any home-cou
ntry." "True, b
ut just you con
sider, almost a
ll of us are si
mple folk. And 
in France, too,
 the majority o
f men are labou
rers, workmen, 
or poor clerks.
 Now just why w
ould a French b
lacksmith or a 
French shoemake
r want to attac
k us? No, it is
 merely the rul
ers. I had neve
r seen a French
man before I ca
me here, and it
 will be just t
he same with th
e majority of F
renchmen as reg
ards us. They w
eren't asked ab
out it any more
 than we were."
 "Then what exa
ctly is the war
 for?" asks Tja
den. Kat shrugs
 his shoulders.
 "There must be
 some people to
 whom the war i
s useful." "Wel
l, I'm not one 
of them," grins
 Tjaden. "Not y
ou, nor anybody
 else here." "W
ho are they the
n?" persists Tj
aden. "It isn't
 any use to the
 Kaiser either.
 He has everyth
ing he can want
 already." "I'm
 not so sure ab
out that," cont
radicts Kat, "h
e has not had a
 war up till no
w. And every fu
ll-grown empero
r requires at l
east one war, o
therwise he wou
ldn't become fa
mous. You look 
in your school 
books." "And ge
nerals too," ad
ds Detering, "t
hey become famo
us through war.
" "Even more fa
mous than emper
ors," adds Kat.
 "There are oth
er people back 
behind there wh
o profit by the
 war, that's ce
rtain," growls 
Detering. "I th
ink it is more 
a kind of fever
," says Albert.
 "No one in par
ticular wants i
t, and then all
 at once there 
it is. We didn'
t want the war,
 the others say
 the same thing
--and yet half 
the world is in
 it all the sam
e." "But there 
are more lies t
old by the othe
r side than by 
us," say I; "ju
st think of tho
se pamphlets th
e prisoners hav
e on them, wher
e it says that 
we eat Belgian 
children. The f
ellows who writ
e that ought to
 go and hang th
emselves. They 
are the real cu
lprits." Müller
 gets up. "Anyw
ay, it is bette
r that the war 
is here instead
 of in Germany.
 Just you take 
a look at the s
hell-holes." "T
rue," assents T
jaden, "but no 
war at all woul
d be better sti
ll." He is quit
e proud of hims
elf because he 
has for once sc
ored over us vo
lunteers. And h
is opinion is q
uite typical he
re, one meets i
t time and agai
n, and there is
 nothing with w
hich one can pr
operly counter 
it, because tha
t is the limit 
of their compre
hension of the 
factors involve
d. The national
 feeling of the
 tommy resolves
 itself into th
is--here he is.
 But that is th
e end of it; ev
erything else f
rom joining up 
onwards he crit
icizes from a p
ractical point 
of view. Albert
 lies down on t
he grass and gr
owls angrily: "
The best thing 
is not to talk 
about the rotte
n business." "I
t won't make an
y difference, t
hat's sure," ag
rees Kat. As fo
r the windfall,
 we have to ret
urn almost all 
the new things 
and take back o
ur old rags aga
in. The good on
es were merely 
for the inspect
ion. * * Instea
d of going to R
ussia, we go up
 the line again
. On the way we
 pass through a
 devastated woo
d with the tree
 trunks shatter
ed and the grou
nd ploughed up.
 At several pla
ces there are t
remendous crate
rs. "Great guns
, something's h
it that," I say
 to Kat. "Trenc
h mortars," he 
replies, and th
en points up at
 one of the tre
es. In the bran
ches dead men a
re hanging. A n
aked soldier is
 squatting in t
he fork of a tr
ee, he still ha
s his helmet on
, otherwise he 
is entirely unc
lad. There is o
nly half of him
 sitting up the
re, the top hal
f, the legs are
 missing. "What
 can that mean?
" I ask. "He's 
been blown out 
of his clothes,
" mutters Tjade
n. "It's funny,
" says Kat, "we
 have seen that
 a couple of ti
mes now. If a m
ortar gets you 
it blows you al
most clean out 
of your clothes
. It's the conc
ussion that doe
s it." I search
 around. And so
 it is. Here ha
ng bits of unif
orm, and somewh
ere else is pla
stered a bloody
 mess that was 
once a human li
mb. Over there 
lies a body wit
h nothing but a
 piece of the u
nderpants on on
e leg and the c
ollar of the tu
nic around its 
neck. Otherwise
 it is naked an
d the clothes a
re hanging up i
n the tree. Bot
h arms are miss
ing as though t
hey had been pu
lled out. I dis
cover one of th
em twenty yards
 off in a shrub
. The dead man 
lies on his fac
e. There, where
 the arm wounds
 are, the earth
 is black with 
blood. Underfoo
t the leaves ar
e scratched up 
as though the m
an had been kic
king. "That's n
o joke, Kat," s
ay I. "No more 
is a shell spli
nter in the bel
ly," he replies
, shrugging his
 shoulders. "Bu
t don't get ten
der-hearted," s
ays Tjaden. All
 this can only 
have happened a
 little while a
go, the blood i
s still fresh. 
As everybody we
 see there is d
ead we do not w
aste any more t
ime, but report
 the affair at 
the next stretc
her-bearers' po
st. After all i
t is not our bu
siness to take 
these stretcher
-bearers' jobs 
away from them.
 * * A patrol h
as to be sent o
ut to discover 
just how far th
e enemy positio
n is advanced. 
Since my leave 
I feel a certai
n strange attac
hment to the ot
her fellows, an
d so I voluntee
r to go with th
em. We agree on
 a plan, slip o
ut through the 
wire and then d
ivide and creep
 forward separa
tely. After a w
hile I find a s
hallow shell-ho
le and crawl in
to it. From her
e I peer forwar
d. There is mod
erate machine-g
un fire. It swe
eps across from
 all directions
, not very heav
y, but always s
ufficient to ma
ke one keep dow
n. A parachute 
star-shell open
s out. The grou
nd lies stark i
n the pale ligh
t, and then the
 darkness shuts
 down again bla
cker than ever.
 In the trenche
s we were told 
there were blac
k troops in fro
nt of us. That 
is nasty, it is
 hard to see th
em; they are ve
ry good at patr
olling, too. An
d oddly enough 
they are often 
quite stupid; f
or instance, bo
th Kat and Krop
p were once abl
e to shoot down
 a black enemy 
patrol because 
the fellows in 
their enthusias
m for cigarette
s smoked while 
they were creep
ing about. Kat 
and Albert had 
simply to aim a
t the glowing e
nds of the ciga
rettes. A bomb 
or something la
nds close besid
e me. I have no
t heard it comi
ng and am terri
fied. At the sa
me moment a sen
seless fear tak
es hold on me. 
Here I am alone
 and almost hel
pless in the da
rk--perhaps two
 other eyes hav
e been watching
 me for a long 
while from anot
her shell-hole 
in front of me,
 and a bomb lie
s ready to blow
 me to pieces. 
I try to pull m
yself together.
 It is not my f
irst patrol and
 not a particul
arly risky one.
 But it is the 
first since my 
leave, and besi
des, the lie of
 the land is st
ill rather stra
nge to me. I te
ll myself that 
my alarm is abs
urd, that there
 is probably no
thing at all th
ere in the dark
ness watching m
e, because othe
rwise the missi
le would not ha
ve landed so fl
at. It is in va
in. In whirling
 confusion my t
houghts hum in 
my brain--I hea
r the warning v
oice of my moth
er, I see the R
ussians with th
e flowing beard
s leaning again
st the wire fen
ce, I have a br
ight picture of
 a canteen with
 stools, of a c
inema in Valenc
iennes; torment
ed, terrified, 
in my imaginati
on I see the gr
ey, impalpable 
muzzle of a rif
le which moves 
noiselessly bef
ore me whicheve
r way I try to 
turn my head. T
he sweat breaks
 out from every
 pore. I still 
continue to lie
 in my shallow 
bowl. I look at
 the time; only
 a few minutes 
have passed. My
 forehead is we
t, the sockets 
of my eyes are 
damp, my hands 
tremble, and I 
am panting soft
ly. It is nothi
ng but an awful
 spasm of fear,
 a simple anima
l fear of pokin
g out my head a
nd crawling on 
farther. All my
 efforts subsid
e like froth in
to the one desi
re to be able j
ust to stay lyi
ng there. My li
mbs are glued t
o the earth. I 
make a vain att
empt;--they ref
use to come awa
y. I press myse
lf down on the 
earth, I cannot
 go forward, I 
make up my mind
 to stay lying 
there. But imme
diately the wav
e floods over m
e anew, a mingl
ed sense of sha
me, of remorse,
 and yet at the
 same time of s
ecurity. I rais
e myself up a l
ittle to take a
 look around. M
y eyes burn wit
h staring into 
the dark. A sta
r-shell goes up
;--I duck down 
again. I wage a
 wild and sense
less fight, I w
ant to get out 
of the hollow a
nd yet slide ba
ck into it agai
n, I say "You m
ust, it is your
 comrades, it i
s not any idiot
ic command," an
d again: "What 
does it matter 
to me, I have o
nly one life to
 lose----" That
 is the result 
of all this lea
ve, I reproach 
myself bitterly
. But I cannot 
convince myself
, I become terr
ibly faint. I r
aise myself slo
wly and reach f
orward with my 
arms, dragging 
my body after m
e and then lie 
on the edge of 
the shell-hole,
 half in and ha
lf out. There I
 hear sounds an
d drop back. Su
spicious sounds
 can be detecte
d clearly despi
te the noise of
 the artillery-
fire. I listen;
 the sound is b
ehind me. They 
are our people 
moving along th
e trench. Now I
 hear muffled v
oices. To judge
 by the tone th
at might be Kat
 talking. At on
ce a new warmth
 flows through 
me. These voice
s, these few qu
iet words, thes
e footsteps in 
the trench behi
nd me recall me
 at a bound fro
m the terrible 
loneliness and 
fear of death b
y which I had b
een almost dest
royed. They are
 more to me tha
n life, these v
oices, they are
 more than moth
erliness and mo
re than fear; t
hey are the str
ongest, most co
mforting thing 
there is anywhe
re: they are th
e voices of my 
comrades. I am 
no longer a shu
ddering speck o
f existence, al
one in the dark
ness;--I belong
 to them and th
ey to me, we al
l share the sam
e fear and the 
same life, we a
re nearer than 
lovers, in a si
mpler, a harder
 way; I could b
ury my face in 
them, in these 
voices, these w
ords that have 
saved me and wi
ll stand by me.
 * * Cautiously
 I glide out ov
er the edge and
 snake my way f
orward. I shuff
le along on all
 fours a bit fa
rther, I keep t
rack of my bear
ings, look arou
nd me and obser
ve the distribu
tion of the gun
fire so as to b
e able to find 
my way back. Th
en I try to get
 in touch with 
the others. I a
m still afraid,
 but it is an i
ntelligent fear
, an extraordin
arily heightene
d caution. The 
night is windy 
and shadows fli
t hither and th
ither in the fl
icker of the gu
nfire. It revea
ls too little a
nd too much. Of
ten I peer ahea
d, but always f
or nothing. Thu
s I advance a l
ong way and the
n turn back in 
a wide curve. I
 have not estab
lished touch wi
th the others. 
Every yard near
er our trench f
ills me with co
nfidence;--and 
with haste, too
. It would be b
ad to get lost 
now. Then a new
 fear lays hold
 of me. I can n
o longer rememb
er the directio
n. Quiet, I squ
at in a shell-h
ole and try to 
locate myself. 
More than once 
it has happened
 that some fell
ow has jumped j
oyfully into a 
trench only the
n to discover t
hat it was the 
wrong one. Afte
r a little time
 I listen again
, but still I a
m not sure. The
 confusion of s
hell-holes now 
seems so bewild
ering that I ca
n no longer tel
l in my agitati
on which way I 
should go. Perh
aps I am crawli
ng parallel to 
the lines, and 
that might go o
n for ever. So 
I crawl round o
nce again in a 
wide curve. The
se damned rocke
ts! They seem t
o burn for an h
our, and a man 
cannot make the
 least movement
 without bringi
ng the bullets 
whistling round
. But there is 
nothing for it,
 I must get out
. Falteringly I
 work my way fa
rther, I move o
ff over the gro
und like a crab
 and rip my han
ds sorely on th
e jagged splint
ers, as sharp a
s razor blades.
 Often I think 
that the sky is
 becoming light
er on the horiz
on, but it may 
be merely my im
agination. Then
 gradually I re
alize that to c
rawl in the rig
ht direction is
 a matter of li
fe or death. A 
shell crashes. 
Almost immediat
ely two others.
 And then it be
gins in earnest
. A bombardment
. Machine-guns 
rattle. Now the
re is nothing f
or it but to st
ay lying low. A
pparently an at
tack is coming.
 Everywhere the
 rockets shoot 
up. Unceasing. 
I lie huddled i
n a large shell
-hole, my legs 
in the water up
 to the belly. 
When the attack
 starts I will 
let myself fall
 into the water
, with my face 
as deep in the 
mud as I can ke
ep it without s
uffocating. I m
ust pretend to 
be dead. Sudden
ly I hear the b
arrage lift. At
 once I slip do
wn into the wat
er, my helmet o
n the nape of m
y neck and my m
outh just clear
 so that I can 
get a breath of
 air. I lie mot
ionless;--somew
here something 
clanks, it stam
ps and stumbles
 nearer--all my
 nerves become 
taut and icy. I
t clatters over
 me and away, t
he first wave h
as passed. I ha
ve but this one
 shattering tho
ught: What will
 you do if some
one jumps into 
your shell-hole
?-- Swiftly I p
ull out my litt
le dagger, gras
p it fast and b
ury it in my ha
nd once again u
nder the mud. I
f anyone jumps 
in here I will 
go for him; it 
hammers in my f
orehead; at onc
e, stab him cle
an through the 
throat, so that
 he cannot call
 out; that's th
e only way; he 
will be just as
 frightened as 
I am, when in t
error we fall u
pon one another
, then I must b
e first. Now ou
r batteries are
 firing. A shel
l lands near me
. That makes me
 savage with fu
ry, all it need
s now is to be 
killed by our o
wn shells; I cu
rse and grind m
y teeth in the 
mud; it is a ra
ving frenzy; in
 the end all I 
can do is groan
 and pray. The 
crash of the sh
ells bursts in 
my ears. If our
 fellows make a
 counter-raid I
 will be saved.
 I press my hea
d against the e
arth and listen
 to the muffled
 thunder, like 
the explosions 
of quarrying--a
nd raise it aga
in to listen fo
r the sounds on
 top. The machi
ne-guns rattle.
 I know our bar
bed wire entang
lements are str
ong and almost 
undamaged;--par
ts of them are 
charged with a 
powerful electr
ic current. The
 rifle fire inc
reases. They ha
ve not broken t
hrough; they ha
ve to retreat. 
I sink down aga
in, huddled, st
rained to the u
ttermost. The b
anging, the cre
eping, the clan
ging becomes au
dible. One sing
le cry yelling 
amongst it all.
 They are raked
 with fire, the
 attack is repu
lsed. * * Alrea
dy it has becom
e somewhat ligh
ter. Steps hast
en over me. The
 first. Gone. A
gain, another. 
The rattle of m
achine-guns bec
omes an unbroke
n chain. Just a
s I am about to
 turn round a l
ittle, somethin
g heavy stumble
s, and with a c
rash a body fal
ls over me into
 the shell-hole
, slips down, a
nd lies across 
me---- I do not
 think at all, 
I make no decis
ion--I strike m
adly home, and 
feel only how t
he body suddenl
y convulses, th
en becomes limp
, and collapses
. When I recove
r myself, my ha
nd is sticky an
d wet. The man 
gurgles. It sou
nds to me as th
ough he bellows
, every gasping
 breath is like
 a cry, a thund
er--but it is o
nly my heart po
unding. I want 
to stop his mou
th, stuff it wi
th earth, stab 
him again, he m
ust be quiet, h
e is betraying 
me; now at last
 I regain contr
ol of myself, b
ut have suddenl
y become so fee
ble that I cann
ot any more lif
t my hand again
st him. So I cr
awl away to the
 farthest corne
r and stay ther
e, my eyes glue
d on him, my ha
nd grasping the
 knife--ready, 
if he stirs, to
 spring at him 
again. But he w
on't do so any 
more, I can hea
r that already 
in his gurgling
. I can see him
 indistinctly. 
I have but one 
desire, to get 
away. If it is 
not soon it wil
l be too light;
 it will be dif
ficult enough n
ow. Then as I t
ry to raise up 
my head I see i
t is impossible
 already. The m
achine-gun fire
 so sweeps the 
ground that I w
ould be shot th
rough and throu
gh before I cou
ld make one jum
p. I test it on
ce with my helm
et, which I tak
e off and hold 
up to find out 
the level of th
e shots. The ne
xt moment it is
 knocked out of
 my hand by a b
ullet. The fire
 is sweeping ve
ry low over the
 ground. I am n
ot far enough f
rom the enemy l
ine to escape b
eing picked off
 by one of the 
snipers if I at
tempt to get aw
ay. The light i
ncreases. Burni
ng I wait for o
ur attack. My h
ands are white 
at the knuckles
, I clench them
 so tightly in 
my longing for 
the fire to cea
se so that my c
omrades may com
e. Minute after
 minute trickle
s away. I dare 
not look again 
at the dark fig
ure in the shel
l-hole. With an
 effort I look 
past it and wai
t, wait. The bu
llets hiss, the
y make a steel 
net, never ceas
ing, never ceas
ing. Then I not
ice my bloody h
and and suddenl
y feel nauseate
d. I take some 
earth and rub t
he skin with it
, now my hand i
s muddy and the
 blood cannot b
e seen any more
. The fire does
 not diminish. 
It is equally h
eavy from both 
sides. Our fell
ows have probab
ly given me up 
for lost long a
go. * * It is e
arly morning, c
lear and grey. 
The gurgling co
ntinues, I stop
 my ears, but s
oon take my fin
gers away again
, because then 
I cannot hear t
he other sound.
 The figure opp
osite me moves.
 I shrink toget
her and involun
tarily look at 
it. Then my eye
s remain glued 
to it. A man wi
th a small poin
ted beard lies 
there, his head
 is fallen to o
ne side, one ar
m is half-bent,
 his head rests
 helplessly upo
n it. The other
 hand lies on h
is chest, it is
 bloody. He is 
dead, I say to 
myself, he must
 be dead, he do
esn't feel anyt
hing any more; 
it is only the 
body that is gu
rgling there. T
hen the head tr
ies to raise it
self, for a mom
ent the groanin
g becomes loude
r, his forehead
 sinks back upo
n his arm. The 
man is not dead
, he is dying, 
but he is not d
ead. I drag mys
elf toward him,
 hesitate, supp
ort myself on m
y hands, creep 
a bit farther, 
wait, again a t
errible journey
 of three yards
, a long, a ter
rible journey. 
At last I am be
side him. Then 
he opens his ey
es. He must hav
e heard me and 
gazes at me wit
h a look of utt
er terror. The 
body lies still
, but in the ey
es there is suc
h an extraordin
ary expression 
of flight that 
for a moment I 
think they have
 power enough t
o carry the bod
y off with them
. Hundreds of m
iles away with 
one bound. The 
body is still, 
perfectly still
, without sound
, the gurgle ha
s ceased, but t
he eyes cry out
, yell, all the
 life is gather
ed together in 
them for one tr
emendous effort
 to flee, gathe
red together th
ere in a dreadf
ul terror of de
ath, of me. My 
legs give way a
nd I drop on my
 elbows. "No, n
o," I whisper. 
The eyes follow
 me. I am power
less to move so
 long as they a
re there. Then 
his hand slips 
slowly from his
 breast, only a
 little bit, it
 sinks just a f
ew inches, but 
this movement b
reaks the power
 of the eyes. I
 bend forward, 
shake my head a
nd whisper: "No
, no, no," I ra
ise one hand, I
 must show him 
that I want to 
help him, I str
oke his forehea
d. The eyes shr
ink back as the
 hand comes, th
en they lose th
eir stare, the 
eyelids droop l
ower, the tensi
on is past. I o
pen his collar 
and place his h
ead more comfor
tably upright. 
His mouth stand
s half open, it
 tries to form 
words. The lips
 are dry. My wa
ter bottle is n
ot there. I hav
e not brought i
t with me. But 
there is water 
in the mud, dow
n at the bottom
 of the crater.
 I climb down, 
take out my han
dkerchief, spre
ad it out, push
 it under and s
coop up the yel
low water that 
strains through
 into the hollo
w of my hand. H
e gulps it down
. I fetch some 
more. Then I un
button his tuni
c in order to b
andage him if i
t is possible. 
In any case I m
ust do it, so t
hat if the fell
ows over there 
capture me they
 will see that 
I wanted to hel
p him, and so w
ill not shoot m
e. He tries to 
resist, but his
 hand is too fe
eble. The shirt
 is stuck and w
ill not come aw
ay, it is butto
ned at the back
. So there is n
othing for it b
ut to cut it of
f. I look for t
he knife and fi
nd it again. Bu
t when I begin 
to cut the shir
t the eyes open
 once more and 
the cry is in t
hem again and t
he demented exp
ression, so tha
t I must close 
them, press the
m shut and whis
per: "I want to
 help you, Comr
ade, camerade, 
camerade, camer
ade----" eagerl
y repeating the
 word, to make 
him understand.
 There are thre
e stabs. My fie
ld dressing cov
ers them, the b
lood runs out u
nder it, I pres
s it tighter; t
here; he groans
. That is all I
 can do. Now we
 must wait, wai
t. * * These ho
urs.... The gur
gling starts ag
ain--but how sl
owly a man dies
! For this I kn
ow--he cannot b
e saved. Indeed
, I have tried 
to tell myself 
that he will be
, but at noon t
his pretence br
eaks down and m
elts before his
 groans. If onl
y I had not los
t my revolver c
rawling about, 
I would shoot h
im. Stab him I 
cannot. By noon
 I am groping o
n the outer lim
its of reason. 
Hunger devours 
me, I could alm
ost weep for so
mething to eat,
 I cannot strug
gle against it.
 Again and agai
n I fetch water
 for the dying 
man and drink s
ome myself. Thi
s is the first 
man I have kill
ed with my hand
s, whom I can s
ee close at han
d, whose death 
is my doing. Ka
t and Kropp and
 Müller have ex
perienced it al
ready, when the
y have hit some
one; it happens
 to many, in ha
nd-to-hand figh
ting especially
-- But every ga
sp lays my hear
t bare. This dy
ing man has tim
e with him, he 
has an invisibl
e dagger with w
hich he stabs m
e: Time and my 
thoughts. I wou
ld give much if
 he would but s
tay alive. It i
s hard to lie h
ere and to have
 to see and hea
r him. In the a
fternoon, about
 three, he is d
ead. I breathe 
freely again. B
ut only for a s
hort time. Soon
 the silence is
 more unbearabl
e than the groa
ns. I wish the 
gurgling were t
here again, gas
ping, hoarse, n
ow whistling so
ftly and again 
hoarse and loud
. It is mad, wh
at I do. But I 
must do somethi
ng. I prop the 
dead man up aga
in so that he l
ies comfortably
 although he fe
els nothing any
 more. I close 
his eyes. They 
are brown, his 
hair is black a
nd a bit curly 
at the sides. T
he mouth is ful
l and soft bene
ath his moustac
he; the nose is
 slightly arche
d, the skin bro
wnish; it is no
w not so pale a
s it was before
, when he was s
till alive. For
 a moment the f
ace seems almos
t healthy;--the
n it collapses 
suddenly into t
he strange face
 of the dead th
at I have so of
ten seen, stran
ge faces, all a
like. No doubt 
his wife still 
thinks of him; 
she does not kn
ow what has hap
pened. He looks
 as if he would
 often have wri
tten to her;--s
he will still b
e getting mail 
from him--To-mo
rrow, in a week
's time--perhap
s even a stray 
letter a month 
hence. She will
 read it, and i
n it he will be
 speaking to he
r. My state is 
getting worse, 
I can no longer
 control my tho
ughts. What wou
ld his wife loo
k like? Like th
e little brunet
te on the other
 side of the ca
nal? Does she b
elong to me now
? Perhaps by th
is act she beco
mes mine. I wis
h Kantorek were
 sitting here b
eside me. If my
 mother could s
ee me----. The 
dead man might 
have had thirty
 more years of 
life if only I 
had impressed t
he way back to 
our trench more
 sharply on my 
memory. If only
 he had run two
 yards farther 
to the left, he
 might now be s
itting in the t
rench over ther
e and writing a
 fresh letter t
o his wife. But
 I will get no 
further that wa
y; for that is 
the fate of all
 of us: if Kemm
erich's leg had
 been six inche
s to the right;
 if Haie Westhu
s had bent his 
back three inch
es further forw
ard---- * * The
 silence spread
s. I talk and m
ust talk. So I 
speak to him an
d say to him: "
Comrade, I did 
not want to kil
l you. If you j
umped in here a
gain, I would n
ot do it, if yo
u would be sens
ible too. But y
ou were only an
 idea to me bef
ore, an abstrac
tion that lived
 in my mind and
 called forth i
ts appropriate 
response. It wa
s that abstract
ion I stabbed. 
But now, for th
e first time, I
 see you are a 
man like me. I 
thought of your
 hand-grenades,
 of your bayone
t, of your rifl
e; now I see yo
ur wife and you
r face and our 
fellowship. For
give me, comrad
e. We always se
e it too late. 
Why do they nev
er tell us that
 you are just p
oor devils like
 us, that your 
mothers are jus
t as anxious as
 ours, and that
 we have the sa
me fear of deat
h, and the same
 dying and the 
same agony--. F
orgive me, comr
ade; how could 
you be my enemy
? If we threw a
way these rifle
s and this unif
orm you could b
e my brother ju
st like Kat and
 Albert. Take t
wenty years of 
my life, comrad
e, and stand up
--take more, fo
r I do not know
 what I can eve
n attempt to do
 with it now." 
It is quiet, th
e front is stil
l except for th
e crackle of ri
fle fire. The b
ullets rain ove
r, they are not
 fired haphazar
d, but shrewdly
 aimed from all
 sides. I canno
t get out. "I w
ill write to yo
ur wife," I say
 hastily to the
 dead man, "I w
ill write to he
r, she must hea
r it from me, I
 will tell her 
everything I ha
ve told you, sh
e shall not suf
fer, I will hel
p her, and your
 parents too, a
nd your child--
--" His tunic i
s half open. Th
e pocket-book i
s easy to find.
 But I hesitate
 to open it. In
 it is the book
 with his name.
 So long as I d
o not know his 
name perhaps I 
may still forge
t him, time wil
l obliterate it
, this picture.
 But his name, 
it is a nail th
at will be hamm
ered into me an
d never come ou
t again. It has
 the power to r
ecall this for 
ever, it will a
lways come back
 and stand befo
re me. Irresolu
tely I take the
 wallet in my h
and. It slips o
ut of my hand a
nd falls open. 
Some pictures a
nd letters drop
 out. I gather 
them up and wan
t to put them b
ack again, but 
the strain I am
 under, the unc
ertainty, the h
unger, the dang
er, these hours
 with the dead 
man have confus
ed me, I want t
o hasten the re
lief, to intens
ify and to end 
the torture, as
 one strikes an
 unendurably pa
inful hand agai
nst the trunk o
f a tree, regar
dless of everyt
hing. There are
 portraits of a
 woman and a li
ttle girl, smal
l amateur photo
graphs taken ag
ainst an ivy-cl
ad wall. Along 
with them are l
etters. I take 
them out and tr
y to read them.
 Most of it I d
o not understan
d, it is so har
d to decipher a
nd I know scarc
ely any French.
 But each word 
I translate pie
rces me like a 
shot in the che
st;--like a sta
b in the chest.
 My brain is ta
xed beyond endu
rance. But I re
alize this much
, that I will n
ever dare to wr
ite to these pe
ople as I inten
ded. Impossible
. I look at the
 portraits once
 more; they are
 clearly not ri
ch people. I mi
ght send them m
oney anonymousl
y if I earn any
thing later on.
 I seize upon t
hat, it is at l
east something 
to hold on to. 
This dead man i
s bound up with
 my life, there
fore I must do 
everything, pro
mise everything
, in order to s
ave myself; I s
wear blindly th
at I mean to li
ve only for his
 sake and his f
amily, with wet
 lips I try to 
placate him--an
d deep down in 
me lies the hop
e that I may bu
y myself off in
 this way and p
erhaps even yet
 get out of thi
s; it is a litt
le stratagem: i
f only I am all
owed to escape,
 then I will se
e to it. So I o
pen the book an
d read slowly:-
-Gerard Duval, 
compositor. Wit
h the dead man'
s pencil I writ
e the address o
n an envelope, 
then swiftly th
rust everything
 back into his 
tunic. I have k
illed the print
er, Gerard Duva
l. I must be a 
printer, I thin
k confusedly, b
e a printer, pr
inter---- * * B
y afternoon I a
m calmer. My fe
ar was groundle
ss. The name tr
oubles me no mo
re. The madness
 passes. "Comra
de," I say to t
he dead man, bu
t I say it calm
ly, "To-day you
, to-morrow me.
 But if I come 
out of it, comr
ade, I will fig
ht against this
, that has stru
ck us both down
; from you, tak
en life--and fr
om me--? Life a
lso. I promise 
you, comrade. I
t shall never h
appen again." T
he sun strikes 
low. I am stupe
fied with exhau
stion and hunge
r. Yesterday is
 like a fog to 
me, there is no
 hope of gettin
g out of this y
et. I fall into
 a doze and do 
not at first re
alize that even
ing is approach
ing. The twilig
ht comes. It se
ems to me to co
me quickly now.
 One hour more.
 If it were sum
mer, it would b
e three hours m
ore. One hour m
ore. Now sudden
ly I begin to t
remble; somethi
ng might happen
 in the interva
l. I think no m
ore of the dead
 man, he is of 
no consequence 
to me now. With
 one bound the 
lust to live fl
ares up again a
nd everything t
hat has filled 
my thoughts goe
s down before i
t. Now, merely 
to avert any il
l-luck, I babbl
e mechanically:
 "I will fulfil
 everything, fu
lfil everything
 I have promise
d you----" but 
already I know 
that I shall no
t do so. Sudden
ly it occurs to
 me that my own
 comrades may f
ire on me as I 
creep up; they 
do not know I a
m coming. I wil
l call out as s
oon as I can so
 that they will
 recognize me. 
I will stay lyi
ng in front of 
the trench unti
l they answer m
e. The first st
ar. The front r
emains quiet. I
 breathe deeply
 and talk to my
self in my exci
tement: "No foo
lishness now, P
aul--Quiet, Pau
l, quiet--then 
you will be sav
ed, Paul." When
 I use my Chris
tian name it wo
rks as though s
omeone else spo
ke to me, it ha
s more power. T
he darkness gro
ws. My exciteme
nt subsides, I 
wait cautiously
 until the firs
t rocket goes u
p. Then I crawl
 out of the she
ll-hole. I have
 forgotten the 
dead man. Befor
e me lies the o
n-coming night 
and the pale gl
eaming field. I
 fix my eye on 
a shell-hole; t
he moment the l
ight dies I scu
rry over into i
t, grope farthe
r, spring into 
the next, duck 
down, scramble 
onward. I come 
nearer. There, 
by the light of
 a rocket I see
 something move
 in the wire, t
hen it stiffens
 and lies still
. Next time I s
ee it again, ye
s, they are men
 from our trenc
h. But I am sus
picious until I
 recognize our 
helmets. Then I
 call. And imme
diately an answ
er rings out, m
y name: "Paul--
Paul----" I cal
l again in answ
er. It is Kat a
nd Albert who h
ave come out wi
th a stretcher 
to look for me.
 "Are you wound
ed?" "No, no---
-" We drop into
 the trench. I 
ask for somethi
ng to eat and w
olf it down. Mü
ller gives me a
 cigarette. In 
a few words I t
ell what happen
ed. There is no
thing new about
 it; it happens
 quite often. T
he night attack
 is the only un
usual feature o
f the business.
 In Russia Kat 
once lay for tw
o days behind t
he enemy lines 
before he could
 make his way b
ack. I do not m
ention the dead
 printer. But b
y next morning 
I can keep it t
o myself no lon
ger. I must tel
l Kat and Alber
t. They both tr
y to calm me. "
You can't do an
ything about it
. What else cou
ld you have don
e? That is what
 you are here f
or." I listen t
o them and feel
 comforted, rea
ssured by their
 presence. It w
as mere drivell
ing nonsense th
at I talked out
 there in the s
hell-hole. "Loo
k there for ins
tance," points 
Kat. On the fir
e-step stand so
me snipers. The
y rest their ri
fles with teles
copic sights on
 the parapet an
d watch the ene
my front. Once 
and again a sho
t cracks out. T
hen we hear the
 cry: "That's f
ound a billet!"
 "Did you see h
ow he leapt in 
the air?" Serge
ant Oellrich tu
rns round proud
ly and scores h
is point. He he
ads the shootin
g list for to-d
ay with three u
nquestionable h
its. "What do y
ou say to that?
" asks Kat. I n
od. "If he keep
s that up he wi
ll get a little
 coloured bird 
for his buttonh
ole by this eve
ning," says Alb
ert. "Or rather
 he will soon b
e made acting-s
ergeant-major,"
 says Kat. We l
ook at one anot
her. "I would n
ot do it," I sa
y. "All the sam
e," says Kat, "
it's very good 
for you to see 
it just now." S
ergeant Oellric
h returns to th
e fire-step. Th
e muzzle of his
 rifle searches
 to and fro. "Y
ou don't need t
o lose any more
 sleep over you
r affair," nods
 Albert. And no
w I hardly unde
rstand it mysel
f any more. "It
 was only becau
se I had to lie
 there with him
 so long," I sa
y. "After all, 
war is war." Oe
llrich's rifle 
cracks out shar
p and dry. CHAP
TER X We have d
ropped in for a
 good job. Eigh
t of us have to
 guard a villag
e that has been
 abandoned beca
use it is being
 shelled too he
avily. In parti
cular we have t
o watch the sup
ply dump as tha
t is not yet em
pty. We are sup
posed to provis
ion ourselves f
rom the same st
ore. We are jus
t the right peo
ple for that;--
Kat, Albert, Mü
ller, Tjaden, D
etering, our wh
ole gang is the
re. Haie is dea
d, though. But 
we are mighty l
ucky all the sa
me, all the oth
er squads have 
had more casual
ties than we ha
ve. We select, 
as a dug-out, a
 reinforced con
crete cellar in
to which steps 
lead down from 
above. The entr
ance is protect
ed by a separat
e concrete wall
. Now we develo
p an immense in
dustry. This is
 an opportunity
 not only to st
retch one's leg
s, but to stret
ch one's soul a
lso. We make th
e best use of s
uch opportuniti
es. The war is 
too desperate t
o allow us to b
e sentimental f
or long. That i
s only possible
 so long as thi
ngs are not goi
ng too badly. A
fter all, we ca
nnot afford to 
be anything but
 matter-of-fact
. So matter-of-
fact, indeed, t
hat I often shu
dder when a tho
ught from the d
ays before the 
war comes momen
tarily into my 
head. But it do
es not stay lon
g. We have to t
ake things as l
ightly as we ca
n, so we make t
he most of ever
y opportunity, 
and nonsense st
ands stark and 
immediate besid
e horror. It ca
nnot be otherwi
se, that is how
 we hearten our
selves. So we z
ealously set to
 work to create
 an idyll--an i
dyll of eating 
and sleeping, o
f course. The f
loor is first c
overed with mat
tresses which w
e haul in from 
the houses. Eve
n a soldier's b
ehind likes to 
sit soft. Only 
in the middle o
f the floor is 
there any clear
 space. Then we
 furnish oursel
ves with blanke
ts and eiderdow
ns, luxurious s
oft affairs. Th
ere is plenty o
f everything to
 be had in the 
town. Albert an
d I find a maho
gany bed which 
can be taken to
 pieces, with a
 sky of blue si
lk and a lace c
overlet. We swe
at like monkeys
 moving it in, 
but a man canno
t let a thing l
ike that slip, 
and it would ce
rtainly be shot
 to pieces in a
 day or two. Ka
t and I do a li
ttle patrolling
 through the ho
uses. In very s
hort time we ha
ve collected a 
dozen eggs and 
two pounds of f
airly fresh but
ter. Suddenly t
here is a crash
 in the drawing
 room, and an i
ron stove hurtl
es through the 
wall past us an
d on, a yard fr
om us out throu
gh the wall beh
ind. Two holes.
 It comes from 
the house oppos
ite where a she
ll has just lan
ded. "The swine
," grimaces Kat
, and we contin
ue our search. 
All at once we 
prick up our ea
rs, hurry acros
s, and suddenly
 stand petrifie
d--there runnin
g up and down i
n a little sty 
are two live su
cking pigs. We 
rub our eyes an
d look once aga
in to make cert
ain. Yes, they 
are still there
. We seize hold
 of them--no do
ubt about it, t
wo real young p
igs. This will 
make a grand fe
ed. About twent
y yards from ou
r dug-out there
 is a small hou
se that was use
d as an officer
s' billet. In t
he kitchen is a
n immense firep
lace with two r
anges, pots, pa
ns, and kettles
--everything, e
ven to a stack 
of small choppe
d wood in an ou
thouse--a regul
ar cook's parad
ise. Two of our
 fellows have b
een out in the 
fields all the 
morning hunting
 for potatoes, 
carrots, and gr
een peas. We ar
e quite uppish 
and sniff at th
e tinned stuff 
in the supply d
ump, we want fr
esh vegetables.
 In the dining-
room there are 
already two hea
ds of cauliflow
er. The sucking
 pigs are slaug
htered. Kat see
s to them. We w
ant to make pot
ato cakes to go
 with the roast
. But we cannot
 find a grater 
for the potatoe
s. However, tha
t difficulty is
 soon got over.
 With a nail we
 punch a lot of
 holes in a pot
 lid and there 
we have a grate
r. Three fellow
s put on thick 
gloves to prote
ct their finger
s against the g
rater, two othe
rs peel the pot
atoes, and the 
business gets g
oing. Kat sampl
es the sucking 
pigs, the carro
ts, the peas, a
nd the cauliflo
wer. He even mi
xes a white sau
ce for the caul
iflower. I fry 
the pancakes, f
our at a time. 
After ten minut
es I get the kn
ack of tossing 
the pan so that
 the pancakes w
hich are done o
n the one side 
sail up, turn i
n the air and a
re caught again
 as they come d
own. The suckin
g pigs are bake
d whole. We all
 stand round th
em as before an
 altar. In the 
meantime we rec
eive visitors, 
a couple of wir
eless-men, who 
are generously 
invited to the 
feed. They sit 
in the living-r
oom where there
 is a piano. On
e of them plays
, the other sin
gs 'An der Wese
r.' He sings fe
elingly, but wi
th a rather Sax
on accent. All 
the same it mov
es us as we sta
nd at the firep
lace preparing 
the good things
. Then we begin
 to realize tha
t we are in for
 trouble. The o
bservation ball
oons have spott
ed the smoke fr
om our chimney,
 and the shells
 start to drop 
on us. They are
 those damned s
praying little 
daisy-cutters t
hat make only a
 small hole and
 scatter widely
 close to the g
round. They kee
p dropping clos
er and closer a
ll round us; st
ill we cannot l
eave the grub i
n the lurch. A 
couple of splin
ters whizz thro
ugh the top of 
the kitchen win
dow. The roast 
is already cook
ed. But frying 
the pancakes is
 getting diffic
ult. The explos
ions come so fa
st that the spl
inters strike o
ften and oftene
r against the w
all of the hous
e and sweep in 
through the win
dow. Whenever I
 hear a shell c
oming I drop do
wn on one knee 
with the pan an
d the pancakes,
 and duck behin
d the wall of t
he window. Imme
diately afterwa
rds I am up aga
in and going on
 with the fryin
g. The Saxons s
top singing--a 
fragment has sm
ashed into the 
piano. At last 
everything is r
eady and we org
anize the trans
port of it back
 to the dug-out
. After the nex
t explosion two
 men dash acros
s the fifty yar
ds to the dug-o
ut with the pot
s of vegetables
. We see them d
isappear. The n
ext shot. Every
one ducks and t
hen two more tr
ot off, each wi
th a big can of
 finest grade c
offee, and reac
h the dug-out b
efore the next 
explosion. Then
 Kat and Kropp 
seize the maste
rpiece--the big
 dish with the 
brown, roasted 
sucking pigs. A
 screech, a kne
e bend, and awa
y they race ove
r the fifty yar
ds of open coun
try. I stay to 
finish frying m
y last four pan
cakes; twice I 
have to drop on
 the floor;--af
ter all, it mea
ns four pancake
s more, and the
y are my favour
ite dish. Then 
I grab the plat
e with the grea
t pile of cakes
 and squeeze my
self behind the
 house door. A 
hiss, a crash, 
and I gallop of
f with the plat
e clamped again
st my chest wit
h both hands. I
 am almost in, 
I run like a de
er, sweep round
 the wall, frag
ments clatter a
gainst the conc
rete, I tumble 
down the cellar
 steps, my elbo
ws are skinned,
 but I have not
 lost a single 
pancake, nor ev
en broken the p
late. About two
 o'clock we sta
rt the meal. It
 lasts till six
. We drink coff
ee until half-p
ast seven--offi
cers' coffee fr
om the supply d
ump--and smoke 
officers' cigar
s and cigarette
s--also from th
e supply dump. 
Punctually at h
alf-past seven 
we begin the ev
ening meal. Abo
ut ten o'clock 
we throw the bo
nes of the suck
ing pigs outsid
e the door. The
n there is cogn
ac and rum--als
o from the bles
sed supply dump
--and once agai
n long, fat cig
ars with belly-
bands. Tjaden s
uggests that it
 lacks only one
 thing: Girls f
rom an officers
' brothel. Late
 in the evening
 we hear mewing
. A little grey
 cat sits in th
e entrance. We 
entice it in an
d give it somet
hing to eat. An
d that wakes up
 our own appeti
tes once more. 
Still chewing, 
we lie down to 
sleep. But the 
night is bad. W
e have eaten to
o much fat. Fre
sh baby pig is 
very griping to
 the bowels. Th
ere is an everl
asting coming a
nd going in the
 dug-out. Two, 
three men with 
their pants dow
n are always si
tting about out
side and cursin
g. I have been 
out nine times 
myself. About f
our o'clock in 
the morning we 
reach a record:
 all eleven men
, guards and vi
sitors, are squ
atting outside.
 Burning houses
 stand out like
 torches agains
t the night. Sh
ells lumber acr
oss and crash d
own. Munition c
olumns tear alo
ng the street. 
On one side the
 supply dump ha
s been ripped o
pen. In spite o
f all the flyin
g fragments the
 drivers of the
 munition colum
ns pour in like
 a swarm of bee
s and pounce on
 the bread. We 
let them have t
heir own way. I
f we said anyth
ing it would on
ly mean a good 
hiding for us. 
So we go differ
ently about it.
 We explain tha
t we are the gu
ard and so know
 our way about,
 we get hold of
 the tinned stu
ff and exchange
 it for things 
we are short of
. What does it 
matter anyhow--
in a while it w
ill all be blow
n to pieces. Fo
r ourselves we 
take some choco
late from the d
epot and eat it
 in slabs. Kat 
says it is good
 for loose bowe
ls. Almost a fo
rtnight passes 
thus in eating,
 drinking, and 
roaming about. 
No one disturbs
 us. The town g
radually vanish
es under the sh
ells and we lea
d a charmed lif
e. So long as a
ny part of the 
supply dump sti
ll stands we do
n't worry, we d
esire nothing b
etter than to s
tay here till t
he end of the w
ar. Tjaden has 
become so fasti
dious that he o
nly half smokes
 his cigars. Wi
th his nose in 
the air he expl
ains to us that
 he was brought
 up that way. A
nd Kat is most 
cheerful. In th
e morning his f
irst call is: "
Emil, bring in 
the caviare and
 coffee." We pu
t on extraordin
ary airs, every
 man treats the
 other as his v
alet, bounces h
im and gives hi
m orders. "Ther
e is something 
itching under m
y foot; Kropp, 
my man, catch t
hat louse at on
ce," says Leer,
 poking out his
 leg at him lik
e a ballet girl
, and Albert dr
ags him up the 
stairs by the f
oot. "Tjaden!"-
-"What?"--"Stan
d at ease, Tjad
en; and what's 
more, don't say
 'What,' say 'Y
es, Sir,'--now:
 Tjaden!" Tjade
n retorts in th
e well-known ph
rase from Goeth
e's "Götz von B
erlichingen," w
ith which he is
 always very fr
ee. After eight
 more days we r
eceive orders t
o go back. The 
palmy days are 
over. Two big m
otor lorries ta
ke us away. The
y are stacked h
igh with planks
. Nevertheless,
 Albert and I e
rect on top our
 four-poster be
d complete with
 blue silk cano
py, mattress, a
nd two lace cov
erlets. And beh
ind it at the h
ead is stowed a
 bag full of ch
oice edibles. W
e often dip int
o it, and the t
ough ham sausag
es, the tins of
 liver sausages
, the conserves
, the boxes of 
cigarettes rejo
ice our hearts.
 Each man has a
 bag to himself
. Kropp and I h
ave rescued two
 big red armcha
irs as well. Th
ey stand inside
 the bed, and w
e sprawl back i
n them as in a 
theatre box. Ab
ove us swells t
he silken cover
 like a baldaqu
in. Each man ha
s a long cigar 
in his mouth. A
nd thus from al
oft we survey t
he scene. Betwe
en us stands a 
parrot-cage tha
t we found for 
the cat. She is
 coming with us
, and lies in t
he cage before 
her saucer of m
eat, and purrs.
 Slowly the lor
ries roll down 
the road. We si
ng. Behind us t
he shells are s
ending up fount
ains from the n
ow utterly aban
doned town. * *
 A few days lat
er we are sent 
out to evacuate
 a village. On 
the way we meet
 the fleeing in
habitants trund
ling their good
s and chattels 
along with them
 in wheel-barro
ws, perambulato
rs, and on thei
r backs. Their 
figures are ben
t, their faces 
full of grief, 
despair, haste,
 and resignatio
n. The children
 hold on to the
ir mothers' han
ds, and often a
n older girl le
ads the little 
ones who stumbl
e onward and ar
e for ever look
ing back. A few
 carry miserabl
e-looking dolls
. All are silen
t as they pass 
us by. We are m
arching in colu
mn; the French 
do not fire on 
a town in which
 there are stil
l inhabitants. 
But a few minut
es later the ai
r screams, the 
earth heaves, c
ries ring out; 
a shell has lan
ded among the r
ear squad. We s
catter and flin
g ourselves dow
n on the ground
, but at that m
oment I feel th
e instinctive a
lertness leave 
me which hither
to has always m
ade me do uncon
sciously the ri
ght thing under
 fire; the thou
ght leaps up wi
th a terrible, 
throttling fear
: "You are lost
"--and the next
 moment a blow 
sweeps like a w
hip over my lef
t leg. I hear A
lbert cry out; 
he is beside me
. "Quick, up, A
lbert!" I yell,
 for we are lyi
ng unsheltered 
in the open fie
ld. He staggers
 up and runs. I
 keep beside hi
m. We have to g
et over a hedge
; it is higher 
than we are. Kr
opp seizes a br
anch, I heave h
im up by the le
g, he cries out
, I give him a 
swing and he fl
ies over. With 
one leap I foll
ow him and fall
 into a ditch t
hat lies behind
 the hedge. Our
 faces are smot
hered with duck
-weed and mud, 
but the cover i
s good. So we w
ade in up to ou
r necks. Whenev
er a shell whis
tles we duck ou
r heads under t
he water. After
 we have done t
his a dozen tim
es, I am exhaus
ted. "Let's get
 away, or I'll 
fall in and dro
wn," groans Alb
ert. "Where has
 it got you?" I
 ask him. "In t
he knee, I thin
k." "Can you ru
n?" "I think---
-" "Then out!" 
We make for the
 ditch beside t
he road, and st
ooping, run alo
ng it. The shel
ling follows us
. The road lead
s toward the mu
nition dump. If
 that goes up t
here won't be a
 man of us with
 his head left 
on his shoulder
s. So we change
 our plan and r
un diagonally a
cross country. 
Albert begins t
o drag. "You go
, I'll come on 
after," he says
, and throws hi
mself down. I s
eize him by the
 arm and shake 
him. "Up, Alber
t, if once you 
lie down you'll
 never get any 
farther. Quick,
 I'll hold you 
up." At last we
 reach a small 
dug-out. Kropp 
pitches in and 
I bandage him u
p. The shot is 
just a little a
bove his knee. 
Then I take a l
ook at myself. 
My trousers are
 bloody and my 
arm, too. Alber
t binds up my w
ounds with his 
field dressing.
 Already he is 
no longer able 
to move his leg
, and we both w
onder how we ma
naged to get th
is far. Fear al
one made it pos
sible; we would
 have run even 
if our feet had
 been shot off;
--we would have
 run on the stu
mps. I can stil
l crawl a littl
e. I call out t
o a passing amb
ulance wagon wh
ich picks us up
. It is full of
 wounded. There
 is an army med
ical lance-corp
oral with it wh
o sticks an ant
i-tetanus needl
e into our ches
ts. At the dres
sing station we
 arrange matter
s so that we li
e side by side.
 They give us a
 thin soup whic
h we spoon down
 greedily and s
cornfully, beca
use we are accu
stomed to bette
r times but are
 hungry all the
 same. "Now for
 home, Albert,"
 I say. "Let's 
hope so," he re
plies, "I only 
wish I knew wha
t I've got." Th
e pain increase
s. The bandages
 burn like fire
. We drink and 
drink, one glas
s of water afte
r another. "How
 far above the 
knee am I hit?"
 asks Kropp. "A
t least four in
ches, Albert," 
I answer. Actua
lly it is perha
ps one. "I've m
ade up my mind,
" he says after
 a while, "if t
hey take off my
 leg, I'll put 
an end to it. I
 won't go throu
gh life as a cr
ipple." So we l
ie there with o
ur thoughts and
 wait. * * In t
he evening we a
re hauled on to
 the chopping-b
lock. I am frig
htened and thin
k quickly what 
I ought to do; 
for everyone kn
ows that the su
rgeons in the d
ressing station
s amputate on t
he slightest pr
ovocation. Unde
r the great pre
ssure of busine
ss that is much
 simpler than c
omplicated patc
hing. I think o
f Kemmerich. Wh
atever happens 
I will not let 
them chloroform
 me, even if I 
have to crack a
 couple of thei
r skulls. It is
 all right. The
 surgeon pokes 
around in the w
ound and a blac
kness comes bef
ore my eyes. "D
on't carry on s
o," he says gru
ffly, and hacks
 away. The inst
ruments gleam i
n the bright li
ght like malevo
lent animals. T
he pain is insu
fferable. Two o
rderlies hold m
y arms fast, bu
t I break loose
 with one of th
em and try to c
rash into the s
urgeon's specta
cles just as he
 notices and sp
rings back. "Ch
loroform the sc
oundrel," he ro
ars madly. Then
 I become quiet
. "Pardon me, H
err Doctor, I w
ill keep still,
 but do not chl
oroform me." "W
ell now," he ca
ckles and takes
 up his instrum
ent again. He i
s a fair fellow
, not more than
 thirty years o
ld, with scars 
and disgusting 
gold spectacles
. Now I see tha
t he is torment
ing me, he is m
erely raking ab
out in the woun
d and looking u
p surreptitious
ly at me over h
is glasses. My 
hands squeeze a
round the grips
, I'll kick the
 bucket before 
he will get a s
queak out of me
. He has fished
 out a piece of
 shell and toss
es it to me. Ap
parently he is 
pleased at my s
elf-control, fo
r he seems to b
e more consider
ate of me now a
nd says: "To-mo
rrow you'll be 
off home." Then
 I am put in pl
aster. When I a
m back again wi
th Kropp I tell
 him that appar
ently a hospita
l train comes i
n to-morrow mor
ning. "We must 
work the army m
edical sergeant
-major so that 
we can keep tog
ether, Albert."
 I manage to sl
ip the sergeant
-major two of m
y cigars with b
elly-bands, and
 then tip the w
ord to him. He 
smells the ciga
rs and says: "H
ave you got any
 more of them?"
 "Another good 
handful," I say
, "and my comra
de," I point to
 Kropp, "he has
 some as well. 
We might possib
ly be glad to h
and them to you
 out of the win
dow of the hosp
ital train in t
he morning." He
 understands, o
f course, smell
s them once aga
in and says: "D
one." We cannot
 get a minute's
 sleep all nigh
t. Seven fellow
s die in our wa
rd. One of them
 sings hymns in
 a high cracked
 tenor before h
e begins to gur
gle. Another ha
s crept out of 
his bed to the 
window. He lies
 in front of it
 as though he w
ants to look ou
t for the last 
time. * * Our s
tretchers stand
 on the platfor
m. We wait for 
the train. It r
ains and the st
ation has no ro
of. Our covers 
are thin. We ha
ve waited alrea
dy two hours. T
he sergeant-maj
or looks after 
us like a mothe
r. Although I f
eel pretty bad 
I do not let ou
r scheme out of
 my mind. Occas
ionally I let h
im see the pack
et and give him
 one cigar in a
dvance. In exch
ange the sergea
nt-major covers
 us over with a
 water-proof sh
eet. "Albert, o
ld man," I sudd
enly bethink my
self, "our four
 poster and the
 cat----" "And 
the club chairs
," he adds. Yes
, the club chai
rs with red plu
sh. In the even
ing we used to 
sit in them lik
e lords, and in
tended later on
 to let them ou
t by the hour. 
One cigarette p
er hour. It mig
ht have turned 
into a regular 
business, a rea
l good living. 
"And our bags o
f grub, too, Al
bert." We grow 
melancholy. We 
might have made
 some use of th
e things. If on
ly the train le
ft one day late
r Kat would be 
sure to find us
 and bring us t
he stuff. What 
damned hard luc
k! In our belli
es there is gru
el, mean hospit
al stuff, and i
n our bags roas
t pork. But we 
are so weak tha
t we cannot wor
k up any more e
xcitement about
 it. The stretc
hers are soppin
g wet by the ti
me the train ar
rives in the mo
rning. The serg
eant-major sees
 to it that we 
are put in the 
same car. There
 is a crowd of 
red-cross nurse
s. Kropp is sto
wed in below. I
 am lifted up a
nd put into the
 bed above him.
 "Good God!" I 
exclaim suddenl
y. "What is it?
" asks the sist
er. I cast a gl
ance at the bed
. It is covered
 with clean sno
w-white linen, 
that even has t
he marks of the
 iron still on 
it. And my shir
t has gone six 
weeks without b
eing washed and
 is terribly mu
ddy. "Can't you
 get in by your
self?" asks the
 sister gently.
 "Why yes," I s
ay in a sweat, 
"but take off t
he bed cover fi
rst." "What for
?" I feel like 
a pig. Must I g
et in there?--"
It will get----
" I hesitate. "
A little bit di
rty?" she sugge
sts helpfully. 
"That doesn't m
atter, we will 
wash it again a
fterwards." "No
, no, not that-
---" I say exci
tedly. I am not
 equal to such 
overwhelming re
finement. "When
 you have been 
lying out there
 in the trenche
s, surely we ca
n wash a sheet,
" she goes on. 
I look at her, 
she is young an
d crisp, spotle
ss and neat, li
ke everything h
ere; a man cann
ot realize that
 it isn't for o
fficers only, a
nd feels himsel
f strange and i
n some way even
 alarmed. All t
he same, the wo
man is a tormen
tor, she is goi
ng to force me 
to say it. "It 
is only----" I 
try again, sure
ly she must kno
w what I mean. 
"What is it the
n?" "Because of
 the lice," I b
awl out at last
. She laughs. "
Well, they must
 have a good da
y for once, too
." Now I don't 
care any more. 
I scramble into
 bed and pull u
p the covers. A
 hand gropes ov
er the bed-cove
r. The sergeant
-major. He goes
 off with the c
igars. An hour 
later we notice
 that we are mo
ving. At night 
I cannot sleep.
 Kropp is restl
ess too. The tr
ain rides easil
y over the rail
s. I cannot rea
lize it all yet
; a bed, a trai
n, home. "Alber
t!" I whisper. 
"Yes----" "Do y
ou know where t
he latrine is?"
 "Over to the r
ight of the doo
r, I think." "I
'm going to hav
e a look." It i
s dark, I grope
 for the edge o
f the bed and c
autiously try t
o slide down. B
ut my foot find
s no support, I
 begin to slip,
 the plaster le
g is no help, a
nd with a crash
 I lie on the f
loor. "Damn!" I
 say. "Have you
 bumped yoursel
f?" asks Kropp.
 "You could hea
r that well eno
ugh for yoursel
f," I growl, "m
y head----" A d
oor opens in th
e rear of the c
ar. The sister 
comes with a li
ght and looks a
t me. "He has f
allen out of be
d----" She feel
s my pulse and 
smooths my fore
head. "You have
n't any fever, 
though." "No." 
I agree. "Have 
you been dreami
ng then?" she a
sks. "Perhaps--
--" I evade. Th
e interrogation
 starts again. 
She looks at me
 with her clear
 eyes, and the 
more wonderful 
and sweet she i
s the less am I
 able to tell h
er what I want.
 I am lifted up
 into bed again
. That will be 
all right. As s
oon as she goes
 I must try to 
climb down agai
n. If she were 
an old woman, i
t might be easi
er to say what 
a man wants, bu
t she is so ver
y young, at the
 most twenty-fi
ve, it can't be
 done, I cannot
 possibly tell 
her. Then Alber
t comes to my r
escue, he is no
t bashful, it m
akes no differe
nce to him who 
is upset. He ca
lls to the sist
er. She turns r
ound. "Sister, 
he wants----" b
ut no more does
 Albert know ho
w to express it
 modestly and d
ecently. Out th
ere we say it i
n a single word
, but here, to 
such a lady----
 All at once he
 remembers his 
school days and
 finishes hasti
ly: "He wants t
o leave the roo
m, sister." "Ah
!" says the sis
ter, "but he sh
ouldn't climb o
ut of his bed w
ith his plaster
 bandage. What 
do you want the
n?" she says, t
urning to me. I
 am in mortal t
error at this n
ew turn, for I 
haven't any ide
a what the thin
gs are called p
rofessionally. 
She comes to my
 help. "Little 
or big?" This s
hocking busines
s! I sweat like
 a pig and say 
shyly: "Well, o
nly quite a lit
tle one----" At
 any rate, it p
roduces the eff
ect. I get a bo
ttle. After a f
ew hours I am n
o longer the on
ly one, and by 
morning we are 
quite accustome
d to it and ask
 for what we wa
nt without any 
false modesty. 
The train trave
ls slowly. Some
times it halts 
and the dead ar
e unloaded. It 
halts often. Al
bert is feveris
h. I feel miser
able and have a
 good deal of p
ain, but the wo
rst of it is th
at apparently t
here are still 
lice under the 
plaster bandage
. They itch ter
ribly, and I ca
nnot scratch my
self. We sleep 
through the day
s. The country 
glides quietly 
past the window
. The third nig
ht we reach Her
bstal. I hear f
rom the sister 
that Albert is 
to be put off a
t the next stat
ion because of 
his fever. "How
 far does the t
rain go?" I ask
. "To Cologne."
 "Albert," I sa
y, "we stick to
gether; you see
." On the siste
r's next round 
I hold my breat
h and press it 
up into my head
. My face swell
s and turns red
. She stops. "A
re you in pain?
" "Yes," I groa
n, "all of a su
dden." She give
s me a thermome
ter and goes on
. I would not h
ave been under 
Kat's tuition i
f I did not kno
w what to do no
w. These army t
hermometers are
 not made for o
ld soldiers. Al
l one has to do
 is to drive th
e quicksilver u
p and then it s
tays there with
out falling aga
in. I stick the
 thermometer un
der my arm at a
 slant, and fli
p it steadily w
ith my forefing
er. Then I give
 it a shake. I 
send it up to 1
00.2°. But that
 is not enough.
 A match held c
autiously near 
to it brings it
 up to 101.6°. 
As the sister c
omes back, I bl
ow myself out, 
breathe in shor
t gasps, goggle
 at her with va
cant eyes, toss
 about restless
ly, and mutter 
in a whisper: "
I can't bear it
 any longer----
" She notes me 
down on a slip 
of paper. I kno
w perfectly wel
l my plaster ba
ndage will not 
be re-opened if
 it can be avoi
ded. Albert and
 I are put off 
together. * * W
e are in the sa
me room in a Ca
tholic Hospital
. That is a pie
ce of luck, the
 Catholic infir
maries are note
d for their goo
d treatment and
 good food. The
 hospital has b
een filled up f
rom our train, 
there are a gre
at many bad cas
es amongst them
. We do not get
 examined to-da
y because there
 are too few su
rgeons. The fla
t trolleys with
 the rubber whe
els pass contin
ually along the
 corridor, and 
always with som
eone stretched 
at full length 
upon them. A da
mnable position
, stretched out
 at full length
 like that;--th
e only time it 
is good is when
 one is asleep.
 The night is v
ery disturbed. 
No one can slee
p. Toward morni
ng we doze a li
ttle. I wake up
 just as it gro
ws light. The d
oor stands open
 and I hear voi
ces from the co
rridor. The oth
ers wake up too
. One fellow, w
ho has been the
re a couple of 
days already ex
plains it to us
: "Up here in t
he corridor eve
ry morning the 
sisters say pra
yers. They call
 it Morning Dev
otion. And so t
hat you can get
 your share, th
ey leave the do
or open." No do
ubt it is well 
meant, but it g
ives us aches i
n our head and 
bones. "Such an
 absurdity!" I 
say, "just when
 a man dropped 
off to sleep." 
"All the light 
cases are up he
re, that's why 
they do it here
," he replies. 
Albert groans. 
I get furious a
nd call out: "B
e quiet out the
re!" A minute l
ater a sister a
ppears. In her 
black and white
 dress she look
s like a beauti
ful tea-cosy. "
Shut the door, 
will you, siste
r?" says someon
e. "We are sayi
ng prayers, tha
t is why the do
or is open," sh
e responds. "Bu
t we want to go
 on sleeping---
-" "Prayer is b
etter than slee
p," she stands 
there and smile
s innocently. "
And it is seven
 o'clock alread
y." Albert groa
ns again. "Shut
 the door," I s
nort. She is qu
ite disconcerte
d. Apparently s
he cannot under
stand. "But we 
are saying pray
ers for you too
." "Shut the do
or, anyway." Sh
e disappears le
aving the door 
open. The inton
ing of the Lita
ny proceeds. I 
feel savage, an
d say: "I'm goi
ng to count up 
to three. If it
 doesn't stop b
efore then I'll
 let something 
fly." "Me, too,
" says another.
 I count up to 
five. Then I ta
ke hold of a bo
ttle, aim, and 
heave it throug
h the door into
 the corridor. 
It smashes into
 a thousand pie
ces. The prayin
g stops. A swar
m of sisters ap
pear and reproa
ch us in concer
t. "Shut the do
or!" we yell. T
hey withdraw. T
he little one w
ho came first i
s the last to g
o. "Heathen," s
he chirps, but 
shuts the door 
all the same. W
e have won. * *
 At noon the ho
spital inspecto
r arrives and a
buses us. He th
reatens us with
 clink and all 
the rest of it.
 But a hospital
 inspector is j
ust the same as
 a commissariat
 inspector, or 
any one else wh
o wears a long 
dagger and shou
lder straps, bu
t is really a c
lerk, and is ne
ver considered 
even by a recru
it as a real of
ficer. So we le
t him talk. Wha
t can they do t
o us, anyway---
- "Who threw th
e bottle?" he a
sks. Before I c
an think whethe
r I should repo
rt myself, some
one says: "I di
d." A man with 
a bristling bea
rd sits up. Eve
ryone is excite
d; why should h
e report himsel
f? "You?" "Yes.
 I was annoyed 
because we were
 waked up unnec
essarily and lo
st my senses so
 that I did not
 know what I wa
s doing." He ta
lks like a book
. "What is your
 name?" "Reinfo
rcement-Reservi
st Josef Hamach
er." The inspec
tor departs. We
 are all curiou
s. "But why did
 you say you di
d it? It wasn't
 you at all!" H
e grins. "That 
doesn't matter.
 I have a shoot
ing licence." T
hen, of course,
 we all underst
and. Whoever ha
s a shooting li
cence can do ju
st whatever he 
pleases. "Yes,"
 he explains, "
I got a crack i
n the head and 
they presented 
me with a certi
ficate to say t
hat I was perio
dically not res
ponsible for my
 actions. Ever 
since then I've
 had a grand ti
me. No one dare
s to annoy me. 
And nobody does
 anything to me
." "I reported 
myself because 
the shot amused
 me. If they op
en the door aga
in to-morrow we
 will pitch ano
ther." We are o
verjoyed. With 
Josef Hamacher 
in our midst we
 can now risk a
nything. Then c
ome the soundle
ss, flat trolli
es to take us a
way. The bandag
es are stuck fa
st. We bellow l
ike steers. * *
 There are eigh
t men in our ro
om. Peter, a cu
rly black-haire
d fellow, has t
he worst injury
;--a severe lun
g wound. Franz 
Wächter, alongs
ide him, has a 
shot in the arm
 which didn't l
ook too bad at 
first. But the 
third night he 
calls out to us
, telling us to
 ring, he think
s he has a hæmo
rrhage. I ring 
loudly. The nig
ht sister does 
not come. We ha
ve been making 
rather heavy de
mands on her du
ring the night,
 because we hav
e all been fres
hly bandaged, a
nd so have a go
od deal of pain
. One wants his
 leg placed so,
 another so, a 
third wants wat
er, a fourth wa
nts her to shak
e up his pillow
;--in the end t
he buxom old bo
dy grumbled bad
 temperedly and
 slammed the do
ors. Now no dou
bt she thinks i
t is something 
of the same sor
t and so she is
 not coming. We
 wait. Then Fra
nz says: "Ring 
again." I do so
. Still she doe
s not put in an
 appearance. In
 our wing there
 is only one ni
ght sister, per
haps she has so
mething to do i
n one of the ot
her rooms. "Fra
nz, are you qui
te sure you are
 bleeding?" I a
sk. "Otherwise 
we shall be get
ting cursed aga
in." "The banda
ge is wet. Can'
t anybody make 
a light?" That 
cannot be done 
either. The swi
tch is by the d
oor and none of
 us can stand u
p. I hold my th
umb against the
 button of the 
bell till it be
comes numb. Per
haps the sister
 has fallen asl
eep. They certa
inly have a gre
at deal to do a
nd are all over
worked day afte
r day. And adde
d to that is th
e everlasting p
raying. "Should
 we smash a bot
tle?" asks Jose
f Hamacher of t
he shooting lic
ence. "She woul
dn't hear that 
any more than t
he bell." At la
st the door ope
ns. The old lad
y appears, mumb
ling. When she 
perceives Franz
's trouble she 
begins to bustl
e, and says: "W
hy did not some
one say I was w
anted?" "We did
 ring. And none
 of us here can
 walk." He has 
been bleeding b
adly and she bi
nds him up. In 
the morning we 
look at his fac
e, it has becom
e sharp and yel
low, whereas th
e evening befor
e he looked alm
ost healthy. No
w a sister come
s oftener. * * 
Sometimes there
 are red-cross 
voluntary aid s
isters. They ar
e pleasant, but
 often rather u
nskilled. They 
frequently give
 us pain when r
e-making our be
ds, and then ar
e so frightened
 that they hurt
 us still more.
 The nuns are m
ore reliable. T
hey know how th
ey must take ho
ld of us, but w
e would be more
 pleased if the
y were somewhat
 more cheerful.
 A few of them 
have real spiri
t, they are sup
erb. There is n
o one who would
 not do anythin
g for Sister Li
bertine, this m
arvellous siste
r, who spreads 
good cheer thro
ugh the whole w
ing even when s
he can only be 
seen in the dis
tance. And ther
e are others li
ke her. We woul
d go through fi
re for her. A m
an cannot reall
y complain, her
e he is treated
 by the nuns ex
actly like a ci
vilian. On the 
other hand, jus
t to think of a
 garrison hospi
tal gives a man
 the creeps. Fr
anz Wachter doe
s not regain hi
s strength. One
 day he is take
n away and does
 not come back.
 Josef Hamacher
 knows all abou
t it: "We shan'
t see him again
. They have put
 him in the dea
d room." "What 
do you mean, De
ad Room?" asks 
Kropp. "Well, D
ying Room----" 
"What is that, 
then?" "A littl
e room at the c
orner of the bu
ilding. Whoever
 is about to ki
ck the bucket i
s put in there.
 There are two 
beds in it. It 
is generally ca
lled the Dying 
Room." "But wha
t do they do th
at for?" "They 
don't have so m
uch work to do 
afterwards. It 
is more conveni
ent, too, becau
se it lies righ
t beside the li
ft to the mortu
ary. Perhaps al
so they do it f
or the sake of 
the others, so 
that no one in 
the ward dies i
n sympathy. And
 they can look 
after him bette
r, too, if he i
s by himself." 
"But what about
 him?" Josef sh
rugs his should
ers. "Usually h
e doesn't take 
much notice any
 more." "Does e
verybody know a
bout it then?" 
"Anyone who has
 been here long
 enough knows, 
of course." * *
 In the afterno
on Franz Wachte
r's bed has a f
resh occupant. 
A couple of day
s later they ta
ke the new man 
away, too. Jose
f makes a signi
ficant gesture.
 We see many co
me and go. Ofte
n relatives sit
 by the beds an
d weep or talk 
softly and awkw
ardly. One old 
woman will not 
go away, but sh
e cannot stay t
here the whole 
night through. 
Another morning
 she comes very
 early, but not
 early enough; 
for as she goes
 up to the bed,
 someone else i
s in it already
. She has to go
 to the mortuar
y. The apples t
hat she has bro
ught with her s
he gives to us.
 And then littl
e Peter begins 
to get worse. H
is temperature 
chart looks bad
, and one day t
he flat trolley
 stands beside 
his bed. "Where
 to?" he asks. 
"To the bandagi
ng ward." He is
 lifted out. Bu
t the sister ma
kes the mistake
 of removing hi
s tunic from th
e hook and putt
ing it on the t
rolley too, so 
that she should
 not have to ma
ke two journeys
. Peter underst
ands immediatel
y and tries to 
roll off the tr
olley. "I'm sto
pping here!" Th
ey push him bac
k. He cries out
 feebly with hi
s shattered lun
g: "I won't go 
to the Dying Ro
om." "But we ar
e going to the 
bandaging ward.
" "Then what do
 you want my tu
nic for?" He ca
n speak no more
. Hoarse, agita
ted, he whisper
s: "Stopping he
re!" They do no
t answer but wh
eel him out. At
 the door he tr
ies to raise hi
mself up. His b
lack curly head
 sways, his eye
s are full of t
ears. "I will c
ome back again!
 I will come ba
ck again!" he c
ries. The door 
shuts. We are a
ll excited; but
 we say nothing
. At last Josef
 says: "Many a 
man has said th
at. Once a man 
is in there, he
 never comes th
rough." * * I a
m operated on a
nd vomit for tw
o days. My bone
s will not grow
 together, so t
he surgeon's se
cretary says. A
nother fellow's
 have grown cro
oked; his are b
roken again. It
 is disgusting.
 Among our new 
arrivals there 
are two young s
oldiers with fl
at feet. The ch
ief surgeon dis
covers them on 
his rounds, and
 is overjoyed. 
"We'll soon put
 that right," h
e tells them, "
we will just do
 a small operat
ion, and then y
ou will have pe
rfectly sound f
eet. Enter them
 down, sister."
 As soon as he 
is gone, Josef,
 who knows ever
ything, warns t
hem: "Don't you
 let him operat
e on you! That 
is a special sc
ientific stunt 
of the old boy'
s. He goes abso
lutely crazy wh
enever he can g
et hold of anyo
ne to do it on.
 He operates on
 you for flat f
eet, and there'
s no mistake, y
ou don't have t
hem any more; y
ou have club fe
et instead, and
 have to walk a
ll the rest of 
your life on st
icks." "What sh
ould a man do, 
then?" asks one
 of them. "Say 
No. You are her
e to be cured o
f your wound, n
ot your flat fe
et. Did you hav
e any trouble w
ith them in the
 field? No, wel
l, there you ar
e! At present y
ou can still wa
lk, but if once
 the old boy ge
ts you under th
e knife you'll 
be cripples. Wh
at he wants is 
little dogs to 
experiment with
, so the war is
 a glorious tim
e for him, as i
t is for all th
e surgeons. You
 take a look do
wn below at the
 staff; there a
re a dozen fell
ows hobbling ar
ound that he ha
s operated on. 
A lot of them h
ave been here a
ll the time sin
ce 'fourteen an
d 'fifteen. Not
 a single one o
f them can walk
 better than he
 could before, 
almost all of t
hem worse, and 
most only with 
plaster legs. E
very six months
 he catches the
m again and bre
aks their bones
 afresh, and ev
ery time is goi
ng to be the su
ccessful one. Y
ou take my word
, he won't dare
 to do it if yo
u say No." "Ach
, man," says on
e of the two un
fortunates, "be
tter your feet 
than your brain
-box. There's n
o telling what 
you'll get if y
ou go back out 
there again? Th
ey can do with 
me just as they
 please, so lon
g as I get back
 home. Better t
o have a club f
oot than be dea
d." The other, 
a young fellow 
like ourselves,
 won't have it 
done. One morni
ng the old man 
has the two hau
led up and lect
ures and jaws a
t them so long,
 that in the en
d they consent.
 What else coul
d they do?--The
y are mere priv
ates, and he is
 a big bug. The
y are brought b
ack chloroforme
d and plastered
. * * It is goi
ng badly with A
lbert. They hav
e taken him and
 amputated his 
leg. The whole 
leg has been ta
ken off from th
e thigh. Now he
 hardly speaks 
any more. Once 
he says he will
 shoot himself 
the first time 
he can get hold
 of his revolve
r again. A new 
convoy arrives.
 Our room gets 
two blind men. 
One of them is 
a very youthful
 musician. The 
sisters never h
ave a knife wit
h them when the
y feed him; he 
has already sna
tched one from 
a sister. But i
n spite of this
 caution there 
is an incident.
 In the evening
, while he is b
eing fed, the s
ister is called
 away, and leav
es the plate wi
th the fork on 
his table. He g
ropes for the f
ork, seizes it 
and drives it w
ith all his for
ce against his 
heart, then he 
snatches up a s
hoe and strikes
 with it agains
t the handle as
 hard as he can
. We call for h
elp and three m
en are necessar
y to take the f
ork away from h
im. The blunt p
rongs had alrea
dy penetrated d
eep. He abuses 
us all night so
 that no one ca
n go to sleep. 
In the morning 
he has lock-jaw
. Again beds be
come empty. Day
 after day goes
 by with pain a
nd fear, groans
 and death-gurg
les. Even the D
eath Room is no
 use any more, 
it is too small
; fellows die d
uring the night
 in our room. T
hey go even fas
ter than the si
sters can cope 
with them. But 
one day the doo
r flies open, t
he flat trolley
 rolls in, and 
there on the st
retcher, pale, 
thin, upright a
nd triumphant, 
with his shaggy
 head of curls 
sits Peter. Sis
ter Libertine w
ith beaming loo
ks pushes him o
ver to his form
er bed. He is b
ack from the Dy
ing Room. We ha
ve long suppose
d him dead. He 
looks round: "W
hat do you say 
now?" And even 
Josef has to ad
mit that it is 
the first time 
he has ever kno
wn of such a th
ing. * * Gradua
lly a few of us
 venture to sta
nd up. And I am
 given crutches
 to hobble arou
nd on. But I do
 not make much 
use of them; I 
cannot bear Alb
ert's gaze as I
 move about the
 room. His eyes
 always follow 
me with such a 
strange look. S
o I sometimes e
scape to the co
rridor;--there 
I can move abou
t more freely. 
On the next flo
or below are th
e abdominal and
 spine cases, h
ead wounds and 
double amputati
ons. On the rig
ht side of the 
wing are the ja
w wounds, gas c
ases, nose, ear
, and neck woun
ds. On the left
 the blind and 
the lung wounds
, pelvis wounds
, wounds in the
 joints, wounds
 in the testicl
es, wounds in t
he intestines. 
Here a man real
izes for the fi
rst time in how
 many places a 
man can get hit
. Two fellows d
ie of tetanus. 
Their skin turn
s pale, their l
imbs stiffen, a
t last only the
ir eyes live--s
tubbornly. Many
 of the wounded
 have their sha
ttered limbs ha
nging free in t
he air from a g
allows; underne
ath the wound a
 basin is place
d into which th
e pus drips. Ev
ery two or thre
e hours the ves
sel is emptied.
 Other men lie 
in stretching b
andages with he
avy weights han
ging from the e
nd of the bed. 
I see intestine
 wounds that ar
e constantly fu
ll of excreta. 
The surgeon's c
lerk shows me X
-ray photograph
s of completely
 smashed hip-bo
nes, knees, and
 shoulders. A m
an cannot reali
ze that above s
uch shattered b
odies there are
 still human fa
ces in which li
fe goes its dai
ly round. And t
his is only one
 hospital, one 
single station;
 there are hund
reds of thousan
ds in Germany, 
hundreds of tho
usands in Franc
e, hundreds of 
thousands in Ru
ssia. How sense
less is everyth
ing that can ev
er be written, 
done, or though
t, when such th
ings are possib
le. It must all
 be lies and of
 no account whe
n the culture o
f a thousand ye
ars could not p
revent this str
eam of blood be
ing poured out,
 these torture-
chambers in the
ir hundreds of 
thousands. A ho
spital alone sh
ows what war is
. I am young, I
 am twenty year
s old; yet I kn
ow nothing of l
ife but despair
, death, fear, 
and fatuous sup
erficiality cas
t over an abyss
 of sorrow. I s
ee how peoples 
are set against
 one another, a
nd in silence, 
unknowingly, fo
olishly, obedie
ntly, innocentl
y slay one anot
her. I see that
 the keenest br
ains of the wor
ld invent weapo
ns and words to
 make it yet mo
re refined and 
enduring. And a
ll men of my ag
e, here and ove
r there, throug
hout the whole 
world, see thes
e things; all m
y generation is
 experiencing t
hese things wit
h me. What woul
d our fathers d
o if we suddenl
y stood up and 
came before the
m and proffered
 our account? W
hat do they exp
ect of us if a 
time ever comes
 when the war i
s over? Through
 the years our 
business has be
en killing;--it
 was our first 
calling in life
. Our knowledge
 of life is lim
ited to death. 
What will happe
n afterwards? A
nd what shall c
ome out of us? 
* * The oldest 
man in our room
 is Lewandowski
. He is forty, 
and has already
 lain ten month
s in the hospit
al with a sever
e abdominal wou
nd. Just in the
 last few weeks
 he has improve
d sufficiently 
to be able to h
obble about dou
bled up. For so
me days past he
 has been in gr
eat excitement.
 His wife has w
ritten to him f
rom the little 
home in Poland 
where she lives
, telling him t
hat she has sav
ed up enough mo
ney to pay for 
the fare, and i
s coming to see
 him. She is al
ready on the wa
y and may arriv
e any day. Lewa
ndowski has los
t his appetite,
 he even gives 
away red cabbag
e and sausage a
fter he has had
 a couple of mo
uthfuls. He goe
s round the roo
m perpetually w
ith the letter.
 Everyone has a
lready read it 
a dozen times, 
the post-marks 
have been exami
ned heaven know
s how often, th
e address is ha
rdly legible an
y longer for sp
ots of grease a
nd thumb-marks,
 and in the end
 what is sure t
o happen, happe
ns: Lewandowski
 develops a fev
er, and has to 
go back to bed.
 He has not see
n his wife for 
two years. In t
he meantime she
 has given birt
h to a child, w
hom she is brin
ging with her. 
But something e
lse occupies Le
wandowski's tho
ughts. He had h
oped to get per
mission to go o
ut when his old
 woman came; fo
r obviously see
ing is all very
 well, but when
 a man gets his
 wife again aft
er such a long 
time, if at all
 possible, a ma
n wants somethi
ng else besides
. Lewandowski h
as discussed it
 all with us at
 great length; 
in the army the
re are no secre
ts about such t
hings. And what
's more, nobody
 finds anything
 objectionable 
in it. Those of
 us who are alr
eady able to go
 out have told 
him of a couple
 of very good s
pots in the tow
n, parks and sq
uares, where he
 would not be d
isturbed; one o
f us even knows
 of a little ro
om. But what is
 the use, there
 Lewandowski li
es in bed with 
his troubles. L
ife holds no mo
re joy for him 
if he has to fo
rego this affai
r. We console h
im and promise 
to get over the
 difficulty som
ehow or other. 
One afternoon h
is wife appears
, a tousled lit
tle thing with 
anxious, quick 
eyes like a bir
d, in a sort of
 black, crinkly
 mantilla with 
ribbons; heaven
 knows where sh
e inherited the
 thing. She mur
murs something 
softly and stan
ds shyly in the
 doorway. It te
rrifies her tha
t there are six
 of us men pres
ent. "Well, Mar
ja," says Lewan
dowski, and gul
ps dangerously 
with his Adam's
 apple, "you ca
n come in all r
ight, they won'
t hurt you." Sh
e goes the roun
d and proffers 
each of us her 
hand. Then she 
produces the ch
ild, which in t
he interval has
 done something
 in its napkin.
 From a large h
andbag embroide
red with pearls
 she takes out 
a clean one and
 makes the chil
d fresh and pre
sentable. This 
dispels her fir
st embarrassmen
t, and the two 
begin to talk. 
Lewandowski is 
very fidgety, e
very now and th
en he squints a
cross at us mos
t unhappily wit
h his round gog
gle eyes. The t
ime is favourab
le, the doctor'
s visit is over
, at the most t
here couldn't b
e more than one
 sister left in
 the ward. So o
ne of us goes o
ut to prospect.
 He comes back 
and nods. "Not 
a soul to be se
en. Now's your 
chance, Johann,
 set to." The t
wo speak togeth
er in an undert
one. The woman 
turns a little 
red and looks e
mbarrassed. We 
grin good-natur
edly and make p
ooh-poohing ges
tures, what doe
s it matter! Th
e devil take al
l the conventio
ns, they were m
ade for other t
imes; here lies
 the carpenter 
Johann Lewandow
ski, a soldier 
shot to a cripp
le, and there i
s his wife; who
 knows when he 
will see her ag
ain? He wants t
o have her, and
 he should have
 her, good. Two
 men stand at t
he door to fore
stall the siste
rs and keep the
m occupied if t
hey chance to c
ome along. They
 agree to stand
 guard for a qu
arter of an hou
r or thereabout
s. Lewandowski 
can only lie on
 his side, so o
ne of us props 
a couple of pil
lows against hi
s back. Albert 
gets the child 
to hold, we all
 turn round a b
it, the black m
antilla disappe
ars under the b
ed-clothes, we 
make a great cl
atter and play 
skat noisily. A
ll goes well. I
 hold a club so
lo with four ja
cks which nearl
y goes the roun
d. In the proce
ss we almost fo
rget Lewandowsk
i. After a whil
e the child beg
ins to squall, 
although Albert
, in desperatio
n, rocks it to 
and fro. Then t
here is a bit o
f creaking and 
rustling, and a
s we look up ca
sually we see t
hat the child h
as the bottle i
n its mouth, an
d is back again
 with its mothe
r. The business
 is over. We no
w feel ourselve
s like one big 
family, the wom
an is rather qu
ieter, and Lewa
ndowski lies th
ere sweating an
d beaming. He u
npacks the embr
oidered handbag
, and a couple 
of good sausage
s comes to ligh
t; Lewandowski 
takes up the kn
ife with a flou
rish and saws t
he meat into sl
ices. With a ha
ndsome gesture 
he waves toward
 us--and the li
ttle woman goes
 from one to th
e other and smi
les at us and h
ands round the 
sausage; she no
w looks quite h
andsome. We cal
l her Mother, s
he is pleased a
nd shakes up ou
r pillows for u
s. * * After a 
few weeks I hav
e to go each mo
rning to the ma
ssage departmen
t. There my leg
 is harnessed u
p and made to m
ove. The arm ha
s healed long s
ince. New convo
ys arrive from 
the line. The b
andages are no 
longer made of 
cloth, but of w
hite crêpe pape
r. Rag bandages
 have become sc
arce at the fro
nt. Albert's st
ump heals well.
 The wound is a
lmost closed. I
n a few weeks h
e should go off
 to an institut
e for artificia
l limbs. He con
tinues not to t
alk much, and i
s much more sol
emn than former
ly. He often br
eaks off in his
 speech and sta
res in front of
 him. If he wer
e not here with
 us he would ha
ve shot himself
 long ago. But 
now he is over 
the worst of it
, and he often 
looks on while 
we play skat. I
 get convalesce
nt leave. My mo
ther does not w
ant to let me g
o away. She is 
so feeble. It i
s all much wors
e than it was l
ast time. Then 
I am sent on fr
om the base and
 return once mo
re to the line.
 Parting from m
y friend Albert
 Kropp was very
 hard. But a ma
n gets used to 
that sort of th
ing in the army
. CHAPTER XI We
 count the week
s no more. It w
as winter when 
I came up, and 
when the shells
 exploded the f
rozen clods of 
earth were just
 as dangerous a
s the fragments
. Now the trees
 are green agai
n. Our life alt
ernates between
 billets and th
e front. We hav
e almost grown 
accustomed to i
t; war is a cau
se of death lik
e cancer and tu
berculosis, lik
e influenza and
 dysentery. The
 deaths are mer
ely more freque
nt, more varied
 and terrible. 
Our thoughts ar
e clay, they ar
e moulded with 
the changes of 
the days;--when
 we are resting
 they are good;
 under fire, th
ey are dead. Fi
elds of craters
 within and wit
hout. Everyone 
is so, not only
 ourselves here
--the things th
at existed befo
re are no longe
r valid, and on
e practically k
nows them no mo
re. Distinction
s, breeding, ed
ucation are cha
nged, are almos
t blotted out a
nd hardly recog
nizable any lon
ger. Sometimes 
they give an ad
vantage for pro
fiting by a sit
uation;--but th
ey also bring c
onsequences alo
ng with them, i
n that they aro
use prejudices 
which have to b
e overcome. It 
is as though fo
rmerly we were 
coins of differ
ent provinces; 
and now we are 
melted down, an
d all bear the 
same stamp. To 
re-discover the
 old distinctio
ns, the metal i
tself must be t
ested. First we
 are soldiers a
nd afterwards, 
in a strange an
d shamefaced fa
shion, individu
al men as well.
 It is a great 
brotherhood, wh
ich to a condit
ion of life ari
sing out of the
 midst of dange
r, out of the t
ension and forl
ornness of deat
h, adds somethi
ng of the good-
fellowship of t
he folk-song, o
f the feeling o
f solidarity of
 convicts, and 
of the desperat
e loyalty to on
e another of me
n condemned to 
death--seeking 
in a wholly unp
athetic way a f
leeting enjoyme
nt of the hours
 as they come. 
If one wants to
 appraise it, i
t is at once he
roic and banal-
-but who wants 
to do that? It 
is this, for ex
ample, that mak
es Tjaden spoon
 down his ham-a
nd-pea soup in 
such tearing ha
ste when an ene
my attack is re
ported, simply 
because he cann
ot be sure that
 in an hour's t
ime he will sti
ll be alive. We
 have discussed
 at length, whe
ther it is righ
t or not to do 
so. Kat condemn
s it, because, 
he says, a man 
has to reckon w
ith the possibi
lity of an abdo
minal wound, an
d that is more 
dangerous on a 
full stomach th
an on an empty 
one. Such thing
s are real prob
lems, they are 
serious matters
 to us, they ca
nnot be otherwi
se. Here, on th
e borders of de
ath, life follo
ws an amazingly
 simple course,
 it is limited 
to what is most
 necessary, all
 else lies buri
ed in gloomy sl
eep;--in that l
ies our primiti
veness and our 
survival. Were 
we more subtly 
differentiated 
we must long si
nce have gone m
ad, have desert
ed, or have fal
len. As in a po
lar expedition,
 every expressi
on of life must
 serve only the
 preservation o
f existence, an
d is absolutely
 focussed on th
at. All else is
 banished becau
se it would con
sume energies u
nnecessarily. T
hat is the only
 way to save ou
rselves. In the
 quiet hours wh
en the puzzling
 reflection of 
former days, li
ke a blurred mi
rror, projects 
beyond me the f
igure of my pre
sent existence,
 I often sit ov
er against myse
lf, as before a
 stranger, and 
wonder how the 
unnameable acti
ve principle th
at calls itself
 Life has adapt
ed itself even 
to this form. A
ll other expres
sions lie in a 
winter sleep, l
ife is simply o
ne continual wa
tch against the
 menace of deat
h;--it has tran
sformed us into
 unthinking ani
mals in order t
o give us the w
eapon of instin
ct--it has rein
forced us with 
dullness, so th
at we do not go
 to pieces befo
re the horror, 
which would ove
rwhelm us if we
 had clear, con
scious thought-
-it has awakene
d in us the sen
se of comradesh
ip, so that we 
escape the abys
s of solitude--
it has lent us 
the indifferenc
e of wild creat
ures, so that i
n spite of all 
we perceive the
 positive in ev
ery moment, and
 store it up as
 a reserve agai
nst the onslaug
ht of nothingne
ss. Thus we liv
e a closed, har
d existence of 
the utmost supe
rficiality, and
 rarely does an
 incident strik
e out a spark. 
But then unexpe
ctedly a flame 
of grievous and
 terrible yearn
ing flares up. 
Those are the d
angerous moment
s. They show us
 that the adjus
tment is only a
rtificial, that
 it is not simp
le rest, but sh
arpest struggle
 for rest. In t
he outward form
 of our life we
 are hardly dis
tinguishable fr
om Bushmen; but
 whereas the la
tter can be so 
always, because
 they are so tr
uly, and at bes
t may develop f
urther by exert
ion of their sp
iritual forces,
 with us it is 
the reverse;--o
ur inner forces
 are not exerte
d toward regene
ration, but tow
ard degeneratio
n. The Bushmen 
are primitive a
nd naturally so
, but we are pr
imitive in an a
rtificial sense
, and by virtue
 of the utmost 
effort. And at 
night, waking o
ut of a dream, 
overwhelmed and
 bewitched by t
he crowding fac
es, a man perce
ives with alarm
 how slight is 
the support, ho
w thin the boun
dary that divid
es him from the
 darkness. We a
re little flame
s poorly shelte
red by frail wa
lls against the
 storm of disso
lution and madn
ess, in which w
e flicker and s
ometimes almost
 go out. Then t
he muffled roar
 of the battle 
becomes a ring 
that encircles 
us, we creep in
 upon ourselves
, and with big 
eyes stare into
 the night. Our
 only comfort i
s the steady br
eathing of our 
comrades asleep
, and thus we w
ait for the mor
ning. * * Every
 day and every 
hour every shel
l and every dea
th cuts into th
is thin support
, and the years
 waste it rapid
ly. I see how i
t is already gr
adually breakin
g down around m
e. There is the
 mad story of D
etering. He was
 one of those w
ho kept himself
 to himself. Hi
s misfortune wa
s that he saw a
 cherry tree in
 a garden. We w
ere just coming
 back from the 
front line, and
 at a turning o
f the road near
 our new billet
s, marvellous i
n the morning t
wilight, stood 
this cherry tre
e before us. It
 had no leaves,
 but was one wh
ite mass of blo
ssom. In the ev
ening Detering 
was not to be s
een. Then at la
st he came back
 and had a coup
le of branches 
of cherry bloss
om in his hand.
 We made fun of
 him, and asked
 whether he was
 going to a wed
ding. He made n
o answer, but l
aid them on his
 bed. During th
e night I heard
 him making a n
oise, he seemed
 to be packing.
 I sensed somet
hing amiss and 
went over to hi
m. He made out 
it was nothing,
 and I said to 
him: "Don't do 
anything silly,
 Detering." "Ac
h, why--it's me
rely that I can
't sleep----" "
What did you pi
ck the cherry b
ranches for?" "
I might have be
en going to get
 some more cher
ry branches," h
e replied, evas
ively--and afte
r a while: "I h
ave a big orcha
rd with cherry 
trees at home. 
When they are i
n blossom, from
 the hay loft t
hey look like o
ne single sheet
, so white. It 
is just the tim
e." "Perhaps yo
u will get leav
e soon. You may
 even be sent b
ack as a farmer
." He nodded, b
ut he was far a
way. When these
 peasants are e
xcited they hav
e a curious exp
ression, a mixt
ure of cow and 
yearning god, h
alf stupid and 
half rapt. In o
rder to turn hi
m away from his
 thoughts I ask
ed him for a pi
ece of bread. H
e gave it to me
 without a murm
ur. That was su
spicious, for h
e is usually ti
ght-fisted. So 
I stayed awake.
 Nothing happen
ed; in the morn
ing he was as u
sual. Apparentl
y he had notice
d that I had be
en watching him
;--but the seco
nd morning afte
r he was gone. 
I noticed it, b
ut said nothing
, in order to g
ive him time; h
e might perhaps
 get through. V
arious fellows 
have already go
t into Holland.
 But at roll ca
ll he was misse
d. A week after
 we heard that 
he had been cau
ght by the fiel
d gendarmes, th
ose despicable 
military police
. He had headed
 toward Germany
, that was hope
less, of course
--and, of cours
e, he did every
thing else just
 as idiotically
. Anyone might 
have known that
 his flight was
 only home-sick
ness and a mome
ntary aberratio
n. But what doe
s a court marti
al hundreds of 
miles behind th
e front-line kn
ow about it? We
 have heard not
hing more of De
tering. * * But
 sometimes it b
roke out in oth
er ways, this d
anger, these pe
nt-up things, a
s from an overh
eated boiler. I
t will be enoug
h to tell how B
erger met his e
nd. Our trenche
s have now for 
some time been 
shot to pieces,
 and we have an
 elastic line, 
so that there i
s practically n
o longer any pr
oper trench war
fare. When atta
ck and counter-
attack have wag
ed backwards an
d forwards ther
e remains a bro
ken line and a 
bitter struggle
 from crater to
 crater. The fr
ont line has be
en penetrated, 
and everywhere 
small groups ha
ve established 
themselves, the
 fight is carri
ed on from clus
ters of shell-h
oles. We are in
 a crater, the 
English are com
ing down obliqu
ely, they are t
urning our flan
k and working i
n behind us. We
 are surrounded
. It is not eas
y to surrender,
 fog and smoke 
hang over us, n
o one would rec
ognize that we 
wanted to give 
ourselves up, a
nd perhaps we d
on't want to, a
 man doesn't ev
en know himself
 at such moment
s. We hear the 
explosions of t
he hand-grenade
s coming toward
 us. Our machin
e-gun sweeps ov
er the semicirc
le in front of 
us. The cooling
-water evaporat
es, we hastily 
pass round the 
case, every man
 pisses in it, 
and thus we aga
in have water, 
and are able to
 continue firin
g. But behind u
s the attack cr
ashes ever near
er. A few minut
es and we are l
ost. Then, at c
losest range, a
 second machine
-gun bursts out
. It is set up 
in a crater alo
ngside us; Berg
er has fetched 
it, and now the
 counter-attack
 comes over fro
m behind; we ar
e set free and 
make contact wi
th the rear. Af
terwards, as we
 lie in compara
tively good cov
er, one of the 
food-carriers r
eports that a c
ouple of hundre
d yards distant
 there lies a w
ounded messenge
r-dog. "Where?"
 asks Berger. T
he other descri
bes the place t
o him. Berger g
oes off either 
to fetch the be
ast in or to sh
oot it. Six mon
ths ago he woul
d not have care
d, he would hav
e been reasonab
le. We try to p
revent him. The
n, as he goes o
ff grimly, all 
we can say is: 
"You're mad," a
nd let him go. 
For these cases
 of front-line 
madness become 
dangerous if on
e is not able t
o fling the man
 to the ground 
and hold him fa
st. And Berger 
is six feet and
 the most power
ful man in the 
company. He is 
absolutely mad 
for he has to p
ass through the
 barrage; but t
his lightning t
hat lowers some
where above us 
all has struck 
him and made hi
m demented. It 
affects others 
so that they be
gin to rave, to
 run away--ther
e was one man w
ho even tried t
o dig himself i
nto the ground 
with hands, fee
t, and teeth. I
t is true, such
 things are oft
en simulated, b
ut the pretence
 itself is a sy
mptom. Berger, 
who means to fi
nish off the do
g, is carried o
ff with a wound
 in the pelvis,
 and one of the
 fellows who ca
rry him gets a 
bullet in the c
heek while doin
g it. * * Mülle
r is dead. Some
one shot him po
int blank with 
a Verey light i
n the stomach. 
He lived for ha
lf an hour, qui
te conscious, a
nd in terrible 
pain. Before he
 died he handed
 over his pocke
tbook to me, an
d bequeathed me
 his boots--the
 same that he o
nce inherited f
rom Kemmerich. 
I wear them, fo
r they fit me q
uite well. Afte
r me Tjaden wil
l get them, I h
ave promised th
em to him. We h
ave been able t
o bury Müller, 
but he is not l
ikely to remain
 long undisturb
ed. Our lines a
re falling back
. There are too
 many fresh Eng
lish and Americ
an regiments ov
er there. There
's too much cor
ned beef and wh
ite wheaten bre
ad. Too many ne
w guns. Too man
y aeroplanes. B
ut we are emaci
ated and starve
d. Our food is 
so bad and mixe
d up with so mu
ch substitute s
tuff that it ma
kes us ill. The
 factory owners
 in Germany hav
e grown wealthy
;--dysentery di
ssolves our bow
els. The latrin
e poles are alw
ays densely cro
wded; the peopl
e at home ought
 to be shown th
ese grey, yello
w, miserable, w
asted faces her
e, these bent f
igures from who
se bodies the c
olic wrings out
 the blood, and
 who with lips 
trembling and d
istorted with p
ain, grin at on
e another and s
ay: "It is not 
much sense pull
ing up one's tr
ousers again---
-" Our artiller
y is fired out,
 it has too few
 shells and the
 barrels are so
 worn that they
 shoot uncertai
nly, and scatte
r so widely as 
even to fall on
 ourselves. We 
have too few ho
rses. Our fresh
 troops are ana
emic boys in ne
ed of rest, who
 cannot carry a
 pack, but mere
ly know how to 
die. By thousan
ds. They unders
tand nothing ab
out warfare, th
ey simply go on
 and let themse
lves be shot do
wn. A single fl
yer routed two 
companies of th
em for a joke, 
just as they ca
me fresh from t
he train--befor
e they had ever
 heard of such 
a thing as cove
r. "Germany oug
ht to be empty 
soon," says Kat
. We have given
 up hope that s
ome day an end 
may come. We ne
ver think so fa
r. A man can st
op a bullet and
 be killed; he 
can get wounded
, and then the 
hospital is his
 next stop. The
re, if they do 
not amputate hi
m, he sooner or
 later falls in
to the hands of
 one of those s
taff surgeons w
ho, with the Wa
r Service Cross
 in his button-
hole, says to h
im: "What, one 
leg a bit short
? If you have a
ny pluck you do
n't need to run
 at the front. 
The man is A1. 
Dismiss!" Kat t
ells a story th
at has travelle
d the whole len
gth of the fron
t from the Vosg
es to Flanders;
--of the staff 
surgeon who rea
ds the names on
 the list, and 
when a man come
s before him, w
ithout looking 
up, says: "A1. 
We need soldier
s up there." A 
fellow with a w
ooden leg comes
 up before him,
 the staff surg
eon again says 
A1---- "And the
n," Kat raises 
his voice, "the
 fellow says to
 him: 'I alread
y have a wooden
 leg, but when 
I go back again
 and they shoot
 off my head, t
hen I will get 
a wooden head m
ade and become 
a staff surgeon
." This answer 
tickles us all 
immensely. Ther
e may be good d
octors, and the
re are, lots of
 them; all the 
same, every sol
dier some time 
during his hund
reds of inspect
ions falls into
 the clutches o
f one of these 
countless hero-
grabbers who pr
ide themselves 
on changing as 
many C3's and B
3's as possible
 into A1's. The
re are many suc
h stories, they
 are mostly far
 more bitter. A
ll the same, th
ey have nothing
 to do with mut
iny or lead-swi
nging. They are
 merely honest 
and call a thin
g by its name; 
for there is a 
very great deal
 of fraud, inju
stice, and base
ness in the arm
y.--Is it nothi
ng that regimen
t after regimen
t returns again
 and again to t
he ever more ho
peless struggle
, that attack f
ollows attack a
long the weaken
ing, retreating
, crumbling lin
e? From a mocke
ry the tanks ha
ve become a ter
rible weapon. A
rmoured they co
me rolling on i
n long lines, a
nd more than an
ything else emb
ody for us the 
horror of war. 
We do not see t
he guns that bo
mbard us; the a
ttacking lines 
of the enemy in
fantry are men 
like ourselves;
 but these tank
s are machines,
 their caterpil
lars run on as 
endless as the 
war, they are a
nnihilation, th
ey roll without
 feeling into t
he craters, and
 climb up again
 without stoppi
ng, a fleet of 
roaring, smoke-
belching armour
-clads, invulne
rable steel bea
sts squashing t
he dead and the
 wounded--we sh
rivel up in our
 thin skin befo
re them, agains
t their colossa
l weight our ar
ms are sticks o
f straw, and ou
r hand-grenades
 matches. Shell
s, gas clouds, 
and flotillas o
f tanks--shatte
ring, starvatio
n, death. Dysen
tery, influenza
, typhus--murde
r, burning, dea
th. Trenches, h
ospitals, the c
ommon grave--th
ere are no othe
r possibilities
. * * In one at
tack our Compan
y Commander, Be
rtinck, falls. 
He was one of t
hose superb fro
nt-line officer
s who are forem
ost in every ho
t place. He was
 with us for tw
o years without
 being wounded,
 so that someth
ing had to happ
en in the end. 
We occupy a cra
ter and get sur
rounded. The st
ink of petroleu
m or oil blows 
across with the
 fumes of powde
r. Two fellows 
with a flame-th
rower are seen,
 one carries th
e tin on his ba
ck, the other h
as the hose in 
his hands from 
which the fire 
spouts. If they
 get so near th
at they can rea
ch us we are do
ne for, we cann
ot retreat yet.
 We open fire o
n them. But the
y work nearer a
nd things begin
 to look bad. B
ertinck is lyin
g in the hole w
ith us. When he
 sees that we c
annot escape be
cause under the
 sharp fire we 
must make the m
ost of this cov
er, he takes a 
rifle, crawls o
ut of the hole,
 and lying down
 propped on his
 elbows, he tak
es aim. He fire
s--the same mom
ent a bullet sm
acks into him, 
they have got h
im. Still he li
es and aims aga
in;--once he sh
ifts and again 
takes his aim; 
at last the rif
le cracks. Bert
inck lets the g
un drop and say
s: "Good," and 
slips back into
 the hole. The 
hindermost of t
he two flame-th
rowers is hit, 
he falls, the h
ose slips away 
from the other 
fellow, the fir
e squirts about
 on all sides a
nd the man burn
s. Bertinck has
 a chest wound.
 After a while 
a fragment smas
hes away his ch
in, and the sam
e fragment has 
sufficient forc
e to tear open 
Leer's hip. Lee
r groans as he 
supports himsel
f on his arm, h
e bleeds quickl
y, no one can h
elp him. Like a
n emptying tube
, after a coupl
e of minutes he
 collapses. Wha
t use is it to 
him now that he
 was such a goo
d mathematician
 at school. * *
 The months pas
s by. The summe
r of 1918 is th
e most bloody a
nd the most ter
rible. The days
 stand like ang
els in gold and
 blue, incompre
hensible, above
 the ring of an
nihilation. Eve
ry man here kno
ws that we are 
losing the war.
 Not much is sa
id about it, we
 are falling ba
ck, we will not
 be able to att
ack again after
 this big offen
sive, we have n
o more men and 
no more ammunit
ion. Still the 
campaign goes o
n--the dying go
es on---- Summe
r of 1918--Neve
r has life in i
ts niggardlines
s seemed to us 
so desirable as
 now;--the red 
poppies in the 
meadows round o
ur billets, the
 smooth beetles
 on the blades 
of grass, the w
arm evenings in
 the cool, dim 
rooms, the blac
k, mysterious t
rees of the twi
light, the star
s and the flowi
ng waters, drea
ms and long sle
ep----. O Life,
 life, life! Su
mmer of 1918--N
ever was so muc
h silently suff
ered as in the 
moment when we 
depart once aga
in for the fron
t-line. Wild, t
ormenting rumou
rs of an armist
ice and peace a
re in the air, 
they lay hold o
n our hearts an
d make the retu
rn to the front
 harder than ev
er. Summer of 1
918--Never was 
life in the lin
e more bitter a
nd more full of
 horror than in
 the hours of t
he bombardment,
 when the blanc
hed faces lie i
n the dirt, and
 the hands clut
ch at the one t
hought: No! No!
 Not now! Not n
ow at the last 
moment! Summer 
of 1918--Breath
 of hope that s
weeps over the 
scorched fields
, raging fever 
of impatience, 
of disappointme
nt, of the most
 agonizing terr
or of death, in
sensate questio
n: Why? Why do 
they not make a
n end? And why 
do these rumour
s of an end fly
 about? * * The
re are so many 
airmen here, an
d they are so s
ure of themselv
es that they gi
ve chase to sin
gle individuals
, just as thoug
h they were har
es. For every o
ne German plane
 there come at 
least five Engl
ish and America
n. For one hung
ry, wretched Ge
rman soldier co
me five of the 
enemy, fresh an
d fit. For one 
German army loa
f there are fif
ty tins of cann
ed beef over th
ere. We are not
 beaten, for as
 soldiers we ar
e better and mo
re experienced;
 we are simply 
crushed and dri
ven back by ove
rwhelmingly sup
erior forces. B
ehind us lie ra
iny weeks--grey
 sky, grey flui
d earth, grey d
ying. If we go 
out, the rain a
t once soaks th
rough our overc
oat and clothin
g;--and we rema
in wet all the 
time we are in 
the line. We ne
ver get dry. Th
ose who still w
ear high boots 
tie sand bags r
ound the top so
 that the mud d
oes not pour in
 so fast. The r
ifles are caked
, the uniforms 
caked, everythi
ng is fluid and
 dissolved, the
 earth one drip
ping, soaked, o
ily mass in whi
ch lie the yell
ow pools with r
ed spiral strea
ms of blood and
 into which the
 dead, wounded,
 and survivors 
slowly sink dow
n. The storm la
shes us, out of
 the confusion 
of grey and yel
low the hail of
 splinters whip
s forth the chi
ldlike cries of
 the wounded, a
nd in the night
 shattered life
 groans wearily
 to the silence
. Our hands are
 earth, our bod
ies clay and ou
r eyes pools of
 rain. We do no
t know whether 
we still live. 
Then the heat s
inks heavily in
to our shell ho
les like a jell
y fish, moist a
nd oppressive, 
and on one of t
hese late summe
r days, while b
ringing food, K
at falls. We tw
o are alone. I 
bind up his wou
nd; his shin se
ems to be smash
ed. It has got 
the bone, and K
at groans despe
rately: "At las
t--just at the 
last----" I com
fort him. "Who 
knows how long 
the mess will g
o on yet! Now y
ou are saved---
-" The wound be
gins to bleed f
ast. Kat cannot
 be left by him
self while I tr
y to find a str
etcher. Anyway,
 I don't know o
f a stretcher-b
earer's post in
 the neighbourh
ood. Kat is not
 very heavy; so
 I take him up 
on my back and 
start off to th
e dressing stat
ion with him. T
wice we rest. H
e suffers acute
ly on the way. 
We do not speak
 much. I have o
pened the colla
r of my tunic a
nd breathe heav
ily, I sweat an
d my face is sw
ollen with the 
strain of carry
ing. All the sa
me I urge him t
o let us go on,
 for the place 
is dangerous. "
Shall we go on 
again, Kat?" "M
ust, Paul." "Th
en come." I rai
se him up, he s
tands on the un
injured leg and
 supports himse
lf against a tr
ee. I take up t
he wounded leg 
carefully, then
 he gives a jum
p and I take th
e knee of the s
ound leg also u
nder my arm. Th
e going is more
 difficult. Oft
en a shell whis
tles across. I 
go as quickly a
s I can, for th
e blood from Ka
t's wound drips
 to the ground.
 We cannot shel
ter ourselves p
roperly from th
e explosions; b
efore we can ta
ke cover the da
nger is all ove
r. We lie down 
in a small shel
l hole to rest.
 I give Kat som
e tea from my w
ater bottle. We
 smoke a cigare
tte. "Well, Kat
," I say gloomi
ly, "We are goi
ng to be separa
ted at last." H
e is silent and
 looks at me. "
Do you remember
, Kat, how we c
ommandeered the
 goose? And how
 you brought me
 out of the bar
rage when I was
 still a young 
recruit and was
 wounded for th
e first time? I
 cried then. Ka
t, that is almo
st three years 
ago." He nods. 
The anguish of 
solitude rises 
up in me. When 
Kat is taken aw
ay I will not h
ave one friend 
left. "Kat, in 
any case we mus
t see one anoth
er again, if it
 is peace time 
before you come
 back." "Do you
 think that I w
ill be marked A
1 again with th
is leg?" he ask
s bitterly. "Wi
th rest it will
 get better. Th
e joint is all 
right. It may l
imp a bit." "Gi
ve me another c
igarette," he s
ays. "Perhaps w
e could do some
thing together 
later on, Kat."
 I am very mise
rable, it is im
possible that K
at--Kat my frie
nd, Kat with th
e drooping shou
lders and the p
oor, thin moust
ache, Kat, whom
 I know as I kn
ow no other man
, Kat with whom
 I have shared 
these years--it
 is impossible 
that perhaps I 
shall not see K
at again. "In a
ny case give me
 your address a
t home, Kat. An
d here is mine,
 I will write i
t down for you.
" I write his a
ddress in my po
cket book. How 
forlorn I am al
ready, though h
e still sits he
re beside me. C
ouldn't I shoot
 myself quickly
 in the foot so
 as to be able 
to go with him.
 Suddenly Kat g
urgles and turn
s green and yel
low. "Let us go
 on," he stamme
rs. I jump up, 
eager to help h
im, I take him 
up and start of
f at a run, a s
low steady pace
, so as not to 
jolt his leg to
o much. My thro
at is parched; 
everything danc
es red and blac
k before my eye
s, I stagger on
 doggedly and p
itilessly and a
t last reach th
e dressing stat
ion. There I dr
op down on my k
nees, but have 
still enough st
rength to fall 
on to the side 
where Kat's sou
nd leg is. Afte
r a few minutes
 I straighten m
yself up again.
 My legs and my
 hands tremble.
 I have trouble
 in finding my 
water bottle, t
o take a pull. 
My lips tremble
 as I try to dr
ink. But I smil
e--Kat is saved
. After a while
 I begin to sor
t out the confu
sion of voices 
that falls on m
y ears. "You mi
ght have spared
 yourself that,
" says an order
ly. I look at h
im without comp
rehending. He p
oints to Kat. "
He is stone dea
d." I do not un
derstand him. "
He has been hit
 in the shin," 
I say. The orde
rly stands stil
l. "That as wel
l." I turn roun
d. My eyes are 
still dulled, t
he sweat breaks
 out on me agai
n, it runs over
 my eyelids. I 
wipe it away an
d peer at Kat. 
He lies still. 
"Fainted," I sa
y quickly. The 
orderly whistle
s softly. "I kn
ow better than 
that. He is dea
d. I'll lay any
 money on that.
" I shake my he
ad: "Not possib
le. Only ten mi
nutes ago I was
 talking to him
. He has fainte
d." Kat's hands
 are warm, I pa
ss my arm under
 his shoulders 
in order to rub
 his temples wi
th some tea. I 
feel my fingers
 become moist. 
As I draw them 
away from behin
d his head, the
y are bloody. "
You see----" Th
e orderly whist
les once more t
hrough his teet
h. On the way w
ithout my havin
g noticed it, K
at has caught a
 splinter in th
e head. There i
s just one litt
le hole, it mus
t have been a v
ery tiny, stray
 splinter. But 
it has sufficed
. Kat is dead. 
Slowly I get up
. "Would you li
ke to take his 
pay book and hi
s things?" the 
lance-corporal 
asks me. I nod,
 and he gives t
hem to me. The 
orderly is myst
ified. "You are
 not related, a
re you?" No, we
 are not relate
d. No, we are n
ot related. Do 
I walk? Have I 
feet still? I r
aise my eyes, I
 let them move 
round, and turn
 myself with th
em, one circle,
 one circle, an
d I stand in th
e midst. All is
 as usual. Only
 the Militiaman
 Stanislaus Kat
czinsky has die
d. Then I know 
nothing more. C
HAPTER XII It i
s autumn. There
 are not many o
f the old hands
 left. I am the
 last of the se
ven fellows fro
m our class. Ev
eryone talks of
 peace and armi
stice. All wait
. If it again p
roves an illusi
on, then they w
ill break up; h
ope is high, it
 cannot be take
n away again wi
thout an upheav
al. If there is
 not peace, the
n there will be
 revolution. I 
have fourteen d
ays rest, becau
se I have swall
owed a bit of g
as; in a little
 garden I sit t
he whole day lo
ng in the sun. 
The armistice i
s coming soon, 
I believe it no
w too. Then we 
will go home. H
ere my thoughts
 stop and will 
not go any fart
her. All that m
eets me, all th
at floods over 
me are but feel
ings--greed of 
life, love of h
ome, yearning o
f the blood, in
toxication of d
eliverance. But
 no aims. Had w
e returned home
 in 1916, out o
f the suffering
 and the streng
th of our exper
iences we might
 have unleashed
 a storm. Now i
f we go back we
 will be weary,
 broken, burnt 
out, rootless, 
and without hop
e. We will not 
be able to find
 our way any mo
re. And men wil
l not understan
d us--for the g
eneration that 
grew up before 
us, though it h
as passed these
 years with us 
here, already h
ad a home and a
 calling; now i
t will return t
o its old occup
ations, and the
 war will be fo
rgotten--and th
e generation th
at has grown up
 after us will 
be strange to u
s and push us a
side. We will b
e superfluous e
ven to ourselve
s, we will grow
 older, a few w
ill adapt thems
elves, some oth
ers will merely
 submit, and mo
st will be bewi
ldered;--the ye
ars will pass b
y and in the en
d we shall fall
 into ruin. But
 perhaps all th
is that I think
 is mere melanc
holy and dismay
, which will fl
y away as the d
ust, when I sta
nd once again b
eneath the popl
ars and listen 
to the rustling
 of their leave
s. It cannot be
 that it has go
ne, the yearnin
g that made our
 blood unquiet,
 the unknown, t
he perplexing, 
the oncoming th
ings, the thous
and faces of th
e future, the m
elodies from dr
eams and from b
ooks, the whisp
ers and divinat
ions of women, 
it cannot be th
at this has van
ished in bombar
dment, in despa
ir, in brothels
. Here the tree
s show gay and 
golden, the ber
ries of the row
an stand red am
ong the leaves,
 country roads 
run white out t
o the sky line,
 and the cantee
ns hum like bee
hives with rumo
urs of peace. I
 stand up. I am
 very quiet. Le
t the months an
d years come, t
hey bring me no
thing more, the
y can bring me 
nothing more. I
 am so alone, a
nd so without h
ope that I can 
confront them w
ithout fear. Th
e life that has
 borne me throu
gh these years 
is still in my 
hands and my ey
es. Whether I h
ave subdued it,
 I know not. Bu
t so long as it
 is there it wi
ll seek its own
 way out, heedl
ess of the will
 that is within
 me. He fell in
 October 1918, 
on a day that w
as so quiet and
 still on the w
hole front, tha
t the army repo
rt confined its
elf to the sing
le sentence: Al
l quiet on the 
Western Front. 
He had fallen f
orward and lay 
on the earth as
 though sleepin
g. Turning him 
over one saw th
at he could not
 have suffered 
long; his face 
had an expressi
on of calm, as 
though almost g
lad the end had
 come. CHISWICK
